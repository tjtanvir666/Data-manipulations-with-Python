Service here is not great, it felt like they had forgotten about us and that they didn't care about the service as everything came out one at a time. My friend and I had each ordered a ginger beer, which came out at two separate times (it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that's how long it took).

There is absolutely no vegetarian options, except for the one cold noodle - the mushroom bun is not vegetarian.

The pork belly bun was nothing special - just a piece of meat with the bun. For my vegetarian friend, we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well, and they literally just gave it to us plain, with no sauce, no kimchi.

The Momofuko ramen was awful. It was bland and mushy. After a few bites, I couldn't handle eating anymore.

Momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen. I've had better experience with instant noodles.",9,2,1,positive

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. 

I liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!

To be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return. It certainly wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good either.",2,1,0,positive

The service here was bad. Our servers didn't bother to pay attention to us, and without asking, she gave us the bill before our dessert even arrived!

-Pork Buns - hoisin, scallion, cucumber - $10: I love the pork buns in Momofuku, but it's not something that I would come back for just to have. For $10, these didn't have enough cucumber or scallion. I wish it would have had something pickled to add some tart to the buns and balance the flavour out. In any case, these were delicious and the pork just melt in your mouth, mhmm so good. 

-Winter Ramen - smoked chicken, squash, kale, egg - $15: although this time they improved a bit with the broth, it was still lukewarm, not hot like other authentic Japanese ramen joints. The broth lacked flavor and I didn't taste the kale at all. That small yellow lump in the center is the squash and when mixed with the broth, the entire dish turned too sweet so I don't understand why they felt the need to add squash onto the dish? Also, I'm surprised the egg was poached, hence it had a very runny egg yolk, which is completely different from a traditional Japanese ramen... Normally the egg should be soft-boiled, with the egg white just set and an almost runny egg yolk. The best part of the dish is perhaps the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce seemed to be a teriyaki sauce? Very delicious and flavorful.

-Milk bar soft serve- Twist of Cereal Milk and Fried Apple Pie - $8:  I prefer the cereal milk instead of the fried apple pie. The fried apple pie was overly sweet whereas the cereal milk was done just right. I remember there was a slight salty taste to the cereal milk soft serve, it was really unique and overall, delicious!",2,1,0,positive

I was looking forward to checking it out since we first planned our Toronto trip from LA. My fiancé and I are ramen fans and after the Netflix special, we decided we had to try Momofuku. I gotta say, the look of the place is very cool and we liked how the ramen spot is on the fist floor and the other two Momofukus are on the second and third floor. Very cool design. 
  Now the food; it was good. There was nothing we didn't like and we expected a higher price point. Were we blown away, not really. We started with beers and a bottle of nigori, can't go wrong there. For an appetizer we got the Inari (raw beef over rice with shiso leaf and egg yolk. This was tasty, very different from what I've ever had before.. kind of a beef tar tar sushi almost... yum! We got the BBQ pork buns which were delicious but surprisingly crispy. I'm more used to a melt in your mouth situation, but these were prepared differently.. I loved them though!  Then he had the pork ramen and I had the pepper ramen. His was really amazing. The broth was light yet flavorful, with al dente noodles, a soft boiled egg and fish cake. Mine was interesting. It was a bowl of ramen served in a thick sauce at the bottom rather then broth, and sausage and peppers on top. Probably the most eclectic bowl of ramen I've ever tried, but I gotta say.. I missed the broth. Even if it came with a mini dipping bowl, I think that would have hit the spot. I did dip it a few times in my fiancés broth and LOVED that! I'm always open to trying new things so I'm glad I went out of the box. It's a good thing our server warned us that my ramen would not have broth, otherwise I would have been so confused.. the menu doesn't specify this!
  Overall we had a really nice lunch here! Definitely an out of the box menu here. I wish I had a few more days to try some of the ramen dishes and see if any of the other ones would have tickled my fancy more.

That said, I do like this place. I was a bit surprised that when my bf and I walked in around 6pm on a Thursday evening  we were seated immediately. No waiting at all! We were sited at the bar watching the kitchen area, which was kinda fun. Server was friendly.

Now the food:

Momofuku Ramen - my bf LOVES ramen and he gave a high appraisal. I only sipped a bit of the soup and that was enough for me-- it has a VERY STRONG meaty taste, which exactly why my bf likes it, and I cant really stand...I'm not a big meat-lover and I can't take certain ""meat"" flavor\/taste, and this had it. But i think if you love meat like my bf or many other people, you might find this taste pretty enjoyable. 

Shiitake buns - this taste great but a bit on the salty side. 

Ginger scallion noodles - I LOVE LOVE this!! This is heaven!! It's full of flavors though it only has veggies and may look bland. Again i'm not a fan of ramen, but I can't wait to go back and have this again! 

Japanese yam (side) - it's yam..it makes you full..we didn't really eat much of it since we were pretty much filled by our ramens and buns. I packed it home and had it on the second day - it was actually pretty good.

pudding - sticky date -  this is the only thing that disappointed me...it came on the dry side and nothing really like a ""pudding.""

That somewhere turned out to be the infamous Momofuku Noodle Bar, which I've actually never been to before. The David Chang empire finally made it's way to Canada so I guess you can only avoid it for so long. 

If you've never been before, it's inside the Shangri-La hotel. The inside is modern and upscale with several long communal sharing tables. Upstairs houses the rest of the Momofuku empire (Shoto, Daish?, Nikai and Milk Bar).

I'm not sure why but they don't let your party sit until everyone's there. Seems unnecessary when there were vacant tables...

The menu is broken into snacks, buns, noodles and etc. But don't forget about the truffle rice cakes ($45.00) and cavier & fried chicken ($150.00)! WTF.

- Pork buns ($10.00) - this is what D. Chang is famous for. Tasty and flavourful but $10.00 for two buns is absolute cray.

- Okonomiyaki ($7.00) - as our appetizer, it hit the spot.

- Pork ramen ($16.00) - the broth was decent but nothing special. I felt the same way about the noodles; passable but indifferent. Both slices of pork were good; very tender along with a well executed egg. Overall, their ramen bowls need work.

- Chicken tan tan ramen ($14.00) - the cous got the chicken tan tan and the broth had a decent kick to it from what I tasted.

Branches are never as good as the OG so keep that in mind if you come to Momofuku. Everything we had was decent but it's a tad overrated and overpriced. Personally, I would seek out the more authentic ramen spots.",2,0,0,negative

After having open a location in NYC, he decided to open his very own Momofuku in Toronto.

With two different restaurants located in the same area, he has opened up his eatery to accommodate the fine and the casual. With Momofuku Noodle Bar being the casual and Daisho being fine. Today's review is solely on the Noodle Bar, which I have to admit is awesome but not awesome all at once.

Let me explain. If you are going for the sole purpose of finding the best ramen noodles in town, then this is the wrong place to go. There are a thousand other ramen restaurants within a block radius of Momofuku that are a thousand times better and more traditional. However if you go to Momofuku you are not going for the ramen. You are going for the experience. You first walk into a glass square building attached to the amazing Shangri-La Hotel. First thing you see is a wide open concept with high stools and chairs and a bunch of stairs leading up to a random fridge (will explain later). He keeps the idea of a noodle bar literally like a bar. You sit, eat, drink and leave. The kitchen is pretty open and you can see the cooks do their best work. Good news is it's located right by the underground Path by University Ave and Queen Street. The atmosphere is great and the staff are super nice. They don't have a real beverage bar but simply have a small counter with a mini fridge that stores their beers and drinks.

Going upstairs you will find a fridge filled with Momofuku goodies such as cookies, pies and clothing. Consider this their mini store that specialize in their very own cookies and pies. You are welcome to go up anytime to grab your goodies and bring it down to your table. They will tally it up and add it to your bill at the end. When you get a chance, grab the compost cookies and their crack pie. AMAZE-BALLS!!

As for the food at the noodle bar, I typically get the pork buns and the Momofuku Ramen. The pork buns are two steamed buns stuffed with fatty pork belly, hoisin, scallion, and cucumber. They give you a cute little bottle of Sriracha sauce to go with it. The ramen itself is great but the soup and topics I find aren't too good. It's not filling and you always come out feeling ill as it's super fatty. You get pork belly & shoulder, fish cake, and egg. Again, I definitely only came here for the experience, not the ramen.

Would I come here on a regular basis? Definitely not but I would come when I have a guest and I feel like buying their compost cookies, which by the way I bought 12 of them for $22 the other day. 

Definitely worth trying.",10,1,1,positive

I'm a sucker for Pork Belly Buns and Momofuku makes them right! I don't think ""two"" very thick slices of pork belly are necessary for this dish but I couldn't complain about the flavor.

We next ordered the Pork Ramen of which I was highly disappointed in. The bowl and presentation was beautiful as you can see in the photos I attached, however the flavor was totally bland! The dish was missing so much flavor and was very watered down. 

The Fried Chicken and Caviar Don rice bowl was very good. I loved their fried chicken and would absolutely order this dish again in the future. The last dish we ordered was the Okonomiyaki Burger. The dish did have really nice flavor however I wasn't fond of the consistency of the ""burger buns"" as they seemed undercooked.

Minimalistic setting and attentive staff. Menu has few offering. Known for their ramen and buns I thought I'd try it myself- after all who doesn't love a bowl of ramen?!

Tried the shiitake buns (hoisin, scallion, cucumber)- bun was incredibly soft and flavourful however the filling was inedible! SALT and lots of it! I found myself eating the bun leaving behind the filling. Disappointing as I love me some mushrooms!

Momofuku ramen (pork belly & shoulder, fish cake, egg)- bowl was flavourful with the egg cooked to perfection. Soup was warm as many diners have complained about. On a cold winter day there is nothing worse than getting any but a hot dish!

Friend ordered the Chilled spicy noodles  (sichuan sausage, black bean, cashew)- amazing! Thought this dish rivalled the Momofuku ramen everyone raves about- definitely underrated! This dish would be perfection in the warmer months! Chilled noodles with subtle heat and the cashews offer the perfect complementary flavours.

Full but not satisfied, my friend and I walked upstairs to the Milk bar for some dessert. A nice touch- the server asked if we wanted something brought down or wanted some time to go up and choose ourselves. Although busy, it was nice to see we weren't being rushed to fill tables.

Milk offerings will curb any sweet craving!!
Get the COMPOST COOKIE!! If there ever was a cookie the Cookie Monster would eat this would be it! As the name indicates- a blend of crazy ingredients one being coffee grinds (subtle trust me) and corn flakes to name a few- all the flavours create this ohh so delicious treat! I wanted to go in and buy the whole place out. Definitely the stand out- not the biggest fan of the other cookies.

Although there is no separate entrance to Milk bar, you are able to walk in and browse through the small refrigerated shop at your own leisure. Trust me, I have made a few trips just for the Compost Cookie alone!

It was a bit after one o'clock on a Thursday and we were seated right away. I will say the service was quick, which I really appreciate working in the downtown core (at other restaurants my lunch break has gone 40 minutes over due to slow service). 
The atmosphere is similar to Salad King; they seat you at long tables and they try to keep the turnover rate quick so that more people can eat. 

We ordered the rice cakes for an appetizer, which actually came after our mains arrived. They were really not what we were expecting but they tasted good and the texture was interesting.

After reading other reviews I skipped the ramen and had the chilled spicy noodles. They certainly are spicy! I am the kind of person who can handle a moderate amount of spice, and after a while it built up to be too much for me. The flavours were interesting, though, so I kept eating. The sweet crunchy cashews were my favourite part of the dish. I thought the sausage was a bit to fatty, but others might disagree. 

Overall the experience was what I would expect from a restaurant in the area. It wasn't the best food I've had, but it wasn't bad either. A satisfying lunch with leftovers for my sweetheart. 

If I were basing my decision on price I probably wouldn't go there for lunch again. For the two of us (she ordered a glass of wine; I had a can of lager which for some reason they gave me in a can without a glass. Hipster chic?) it came to about $65. I think that's a bit steep for lunch for two.

The roasted rice cakes (red chili, onion, sesame) ($11) were a bit too hard. The sweet and sour sauce was good but I wish it was softer. This dish was not spicy at all which was great because the main dish I shared with my friend was a bit hot for me.

PORK BUNS. As incredible as they are in New York. Consistency is key.
RAMEN. Good, but not great. The broth was a little too dense for my liking. I seem to recall the broth in my Momofuku Ramen at the original Noodle Bar being a bit thinner. Noodles were chewy. Egg was runny. Pork belly was pork belly.
CHICKEN AND EGG. Husband enjoyed this. Chicken was tender and not remotely lean (remember, you're at Momofuku Noodle bar). I took a bite with all of the ingredients mixed together and thought the cucumber slices set off the flavours really well.
ROASTED RICE CAKES. Nowhere near as tasty as the rice cakes at Ssam bar, with the spicy sausage and all, but still a good snack. Great texture. Bouncy, chewy, firm. They're good.

SERVICE. Excellent, friendly and efficient.
AMBIANCE. Bright, modern, and industrial but comfortable. Surprisingly spacious, especially compared to the cramped digs in New York. Since it was weekday lunch, there was a mixed crowd. Suited-up corporate drones dined happily alongside thick-rim glasses, grandpa sweater wearers.

Food is absolute deliciousness and just as good as in NYC.  Service was awesome.  Did you hear me?  Service was AWESOME!  Great price point and all of you reading this should RUN over there for a meal to remember!  If you go now, you might get a glimpse of Chef Chang himself overlooking the line from the 2nd floor.

Someone requested tasting notes on what I ate last night -- I will try my best, as actually, my tasting buds are clogged a bit from a head cold.  Having said that, Momofuku has the softest of buns that cradle the  most tender juicy slabs of pork belly.  Add to that the crunch of Japanese pickling cucumbers and a sauce that is hoisin-like, but not sure if it's hoisin, it is just a taste sensation for your mouth.  2 buns for $10.

The Ramen -- we ordered the pork belly ramen -- came with 2 pieces of toasted nori, a runny poached egg that you swish in your bowl, green onions, kimchi, etc. and great perfectly cooked not mushy at all ramen noodle.  The broth was comforting and not salty.  It was perfectly seasoned.  Maybe $14?  No more than $17, though, for sure.  

The sticky sweet spicy chicken wings were crisped on the outside, yet there was this glaze that kept them from being dried out.  The chicken was juicy and full of flavor.  $10 - $13, can't remember exactly.  And there were quite a few in the bowl.

The jar of pickled veggies came with radishes, fennel or celery, carrots, a shiitake mushroom, pearl onions, etc. and it was very crunchy and vinagry without being over powered of vinager.  $6 a jar, I think.

We started with the pork buns, they're easy must-haves. To be honest, after settling on the pork buns, I sometimes have a hard time deciding what to order. I'm not a noodle junkie, and some of the more adventurous tasting bowls seem to always use ground meat, which I find a little boring. Buuuuuuuut, on this last visit, after scarfing back our must-have pork buns (we shared), we went a little off-model. I spotted the okonomiyaki burger on the menu, and my lunch-mate waffled on his order and decided to share that with me. We decided to pair the share with the fried cauliflower. Spoiler alert: Score!

The cauliflower was piping hot and really delicate, super yumsville. Very decadent. Like fries, but it's cauliflower. And please just consult the photo to learn about the burger. It was really all that. It was a knife and fork situation. Delicious take on okonomiyaki meets American style diner burger - as far as chopped iceberg lettuce and a Kraft slice. It all worked.

Two of us ended up paying $78 (with tax and tips) for the above, which was quite expensive.  There are better places to spend this money for sure!

Took awhile to get server's attention but he was friendly once he came.  Smoked chicken ramen, Spicy kimchie stew and pork buns.  Smoked chicken soup came first and then it was a wait for my stew and the pork buns came last.  Ramen was tasty and came with nice crispy chicken skin.  Man they should sell bags of it like pork rinds but I guess chicken rinds sounds weird ...

Stew was good with giant bowl of rice.  Both bowls of soup were deceptively huge.  Bowls look big so portion looks small but it seemed like a bottomless bowl of goodness.  Pork buns were delish.  Tender melt in your mouth generous 2 thick slices of pork with hoisin and crunchy cucumbers.

Then the noodle came in a huge bowl withnice presentation I have to say, and decent noodle with nice flavor. 

HOWEVER, the soup is merely LUKEWARM! ! ! As a hufe ramen fan, this is absolutely unacceptable! The essence of ramen is the boiling hot soup that warms your body and soul and also cooks the raw egg on the side. How de hell did any ramen chef come up with this warm ramen broth idea, my egg in the ramen was completely raw with the lukewarm broth ... and of course the ramen is salty to cater the western taste, no complaint there. When I ask for clear broth to water it down, they dont have it, then hot water? She brought a glass of lukewarm tap water ~_~.... serioisly?! You expect me to add lukewarm tap water in ramen????!!! thats when you reach my limit of patience. So I asked the waitress, do you have a macrowave back there?
 "" NO, WE DONT"". 
Then, do you have a pan to boil the water?
 ""DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE MANAGER INSTEAD?!"" 
Oh, ok, id like to. 

Five minutes past, the manager finally came: ""we will boil some hot water for you"". THANK YOU!

From what I gathered, it is a three-level restaurant comprising of ""smaller restaurants"" within it. My friend and I decided to catch up over some ramen at the Noodle Bar, which is on the first floor. Momofuku is quite popular outside of the foodie community. Therefore, my expectations were super high coming into the restaurant.

We arrived during the evening on a Sunday and it was packed. I wasn't a fan of the communal tables, especially since it was crowded. We were squished in the middle between two different groups of people. I had to raise my voice so my friend (and probably the neighbours) could hear what I was saying.

The menu was printed on a piece of paper and since it had the current date, I assumed the menu changes everyday (what a waste of paper!). My friend said the pork buns were great so I agreed to try it. I wasn't overly impressed because I thought it was overpriced and likely something I had before. For my order, I chose the Dan Dan Mein. I was disappointed to see how little the noodles took up in the bowl. Don't give a big bowl if you aren't going to fill it to the top! I liked the noodles but again, nothing I was eager about.

I ordered a Japanese yam cake and some brussel sprouts. The yam cake was kind of mushy and too moist, and it was overly salty drizzled in oyster sauce and topped with mayo (?!). I've been to Guu, so I think that's what they're aiming at. But it's farrr from the Guu quality. Didnt' like it. 

The brussel sprouts had kimchi made of apples (very confusing) and rice mixed with chili and cheese bits...okay? It was my way of getting fibre so I ate them all. But the brussel sprouts were very burnt and unevenly tasted.

I realized after visiting Momofuku that Toronto offers way superior ramen joints at fraction of Momo's cost, so I get it.

For me, the extremely spicy noodle caught my eye.  I wanted a challenge.  Turns out, it's pretty tolerable.  It was spicy but not like the Korean buldak bokkeum myun challenge-spicy.  And it came with a tiny glass of iced milk, how awesome.  And it definitely helped a lot when icing my mouth down.

I had to order the kimchi jar, and I'm glad I did because it was really good.  Mmmm...  Way better quality than the ones you get at supermarkets or in Korean restaurants, obviously.

The pork buns were good. Tasted exactly like how it did back when Momo first opened in NYC.  Good and expensive.

The rice cakes were really delicious too.  They let them sit on top of the flat top low and slow for long time and it gave it a crunchy-chewy texture, which I really loved.

But the star of my lunch was the crack pie soft serve cereal milk.  Jesus christ.  The salty sweet combo had me all mesmerized.  I've tried their crack pie before and although it's super heavy, it does pull you in like an addict.  And this was exactly that except I could lick the pie. Lol.  Now, I've read people complaining about its price, I guess it's a bit expensive when you can get a cone 10x bigger at Sweet Jesus for only $6 bones, and people there still complain about how expensive it is.  I say it's all about the flavor, baby.  And how much endorphins ooze out of your brain once you take a bite.

I came into Momofuku Noodle Bar with this godly image of noodles in my head - you know, Kung Fu Panda level noodles. But really when I look back at my visit, it was the appetizer and dessert that really left an impression on me.

First, huge shoutout to the wait staff. I completely screwed up my reservation for Momofuku and only realized the morning of. Regardless of their busy lunch rush, they allocated space for my party of 5 to dine anyways. That was pretty cool of them.

What I ordered: I came in for Winterlicious and ordered the Chicken Meatball Bun, the Ginger Scallion Noodle, and the Cereal Milk Soft Serve Ice cream. My friends ordered the BBQ Pork Bun, the Smoked Chicken Ramen, and the Chilled Spicy Noodle. 

Chicken Meatball Bun: hoooooooooooooooooooolyyyyyyy this was the most delicious bun I ever ate I thought I was going to cry. This is not your typical Chinese dish. The bun had a heavenly soft texture to it, the patty was cooked and marinated beautifully, and the pickles and mayonnaise really elevated the overall taste of the dish. I could honestly order five of these instead of the noodles (it was THAT good). From what I sampled (stole) from my friends, I definitely preferred this bun over the BBQ pork bun.

Ginger Scallion Noodle: this dish tasted really earthly and organic. There weren't any spices or flavours that really stood out to me, but something about the taste was really ""curious."" I can't really describe it, but it definitely was not a blow-me-out-of-water noodle.

Chicken Ramen: I've definitely had better ramen - this one in particular was unnecessarily salty, mechanical, and thick.  This dish was the only soup option available. 

Spicy Noodle: really liked this one. If you were a fan of the Chicken Meatball Bun, this dish is definitely the one for you. There were really flavourful sausages, nuts, and the dressing of the noodle was seasoned wonderfully.

Finally, the Cereal Millk Soft Serve: so I was one of those people who went into Momofuku thinking about the mouthwatering Masterchef videos of Christina Tosi's creations. And if you've ever watched the most recent season of Masterchef USA, you probably know that they relentlessly advocated for Tosi's Milk Bar desserts over and over. When I saw Cereal Milk on the menu, I knew I had to try it - and of course, the dessert totally surpassed my expectations. The ice cream was really unique and I totally recommend everyone to try it sometime (it seriously tastes like Cereal milk).

Overall, enjoyed my experience here at Momofuku. Of course, it didn't really change my life forever, but I could definitely see myself coming back again (but let's give my wallet a break first). Thanks Momofuku Noodle Bar!",0,1,0,negative

Let me preface this in that I was at Sansotei and Kinton in the same week before trying this and have been to various Ipoudo locations and Totto Ramen in NYC. 

If you are going to call yourself a noodle bar and the first noodle item on your menu appears to be the signature dish it should be no less than spectacular. Especially for a place with a significant line-up and the $15 price tag. I am not sure if others are giving this place 4+ stars because they are comparing with instant ramen they make at home but my rating is based on my expectation and comparison with what I have had elsewhere. 

Soup: The soup is the most important part of good ramen. It is the soup that holds everything together. Momofuku's soup was a bland and clear broth of nothingness. Tastes like dashi with soy and lacked what one expects from a $15 bowl. With such a weak foundation, everything else about the ramen lacked any depth of flavor. 

Noodles: The noodles had decent el dente texture but lacked flavor. Not only because of the weak stock, the noodles themselves reminded me of simply any Asian thick egg noodle you could get off the shelf. 

Toppings: I enjoyed the pork belly. It was flavorful with a good amount of fat on it. The pulled pork style pork shoulder was ok. The best part of the bowl was the egg done in onsen tamago style. Onsen tamago is labor intensive to make on your own, but the custard-like egg is a treat for egg lovers. The pickled cabbage was a big ""what the heck"" for me. I love good kimchi and sauerkraut so I have no aversion to pickled cabbage on it's own. The problem with this was that it did nothing for the bowl. It was an overpowering distraction especially because of the weak soup.

The pork bun was good.  The bun moist and present, with flavourful pork belly.",25,3,5,positive

While I remember just being ""meh"" the first time, I think I enjoyed my second experience here quite a bit more. I came with a group of 3 other people during peak lunch time on a Wednesday afternoon, and the place was packed. Luckily there was one table left, so we were seated without much of a wait.

For anyone who hasn't been to Momofuku, the place is very open concept, kind of canteen-style seating with long metal tables. Shortly after we were seated, another group of 4 came and sat beside us at our table, but it wasn't a big deal. It gets pretty loud in there, but we still managed to carry on our conversations just fine, and it's a good time overall.

We got pickles and kimchi to start, as well as BBQ pork buns. I remember trying the regular pork buns the first time I came here, and I really enjoyed them. While the BBQ pork buns were also delicious (can't go wrong with that fatty pork and soft white bun), I think I prefer the regular ones with hoisin sauce, because the flavour of the BBQ sauce is stronger and overwhelms the taste of the pork. 

I ordered the signature momofuku ramen, which has pork belly & shoulder, fish cake, and egg. While my noodles weren't mindblowingly good or anything, I will say that the texture of the noodles was pretty perfect - not soggy, just chewy enough, but not too hard. The soup was also great, because it wasn't too salty, the way it is at a lot of other ramen places. 

Finished off with a ""twist"" soft serve ice cream with corn flakes, which was the perfect end to the meal. The ice cream is soooo so creamy, it's fantastic. It's not super sweet either, plus there's actually a very slight salty taste to it... from the cornflakes maybe? But it works, and it's unique, and it's delicious!",2,0,0,positive

It reminded me of peking duck. If you're a fan of that, you should definitely give this a try. 

The ramen here is better than that at Sansotei, although pricier. It was a nice chewy consistency, the broth was amazing and I was happy with the thickness of the meat. 

The only downside is that that I wish they had individual tables rather than a giant picnic type  they have where you can touch elbows with the strangers dining next to you.

We've been planning to visit this restaurant for a quite a while. Eventually, we got a chance to make a reservation for 7 people on a weekday, for a business lunch. We were running a bit late, so we called in advance to see if they can accommodate us 20 minutes later. They assured us it wasn't a problem and they can push the reservation.

We showed up for the new time slot and were told they don't have a table for us, as they only keep reservations for 15 minutes. After explaining that we had rescheduled and had been assured that was not an issue, we were simply told that they didn't know what we were talking about and had no idea who we had spoken to.

There were quite a few people at the restaurant, so we asked what the estimated wait time was, and were told it was about 20 minutes. We momentarily discussed it in the group, and decided to go elsewhere - there's only so much time for a work lunch. We told the staff and they informed us a table for 7 was freeing up and they would be able to seat us in 5 minutes. Great, optimistically, we decided to wait.

Fast forward 15 minutes, nothing has happened. We checked in and were told our table would be ready soon.

Fast forward another 15 minutes, our table is finally ready and they call us in. At this point, there's 6 of us - we've been waiting for 30 minutes and one of our colleagues had to run to another meeting. To our surprise, we're told they cannot seat us as they only have a table for 7 ready.

I had a bite of the Jijang and it was super flavourful. But I couldn't believe how good my bowl was. Something about the combination of the cashews, spinach, sausage, and noodles all in one bite was SO good. Probably one of the best bowls of food I've had in awhile. Might help that I am a noodle-phile. 

We visited the milk bar after that a bought a few cookies, all of which were great. 

Our server was really nice. There was a mix-up near the beginning, and she sincerely apologized for it.

Noodle Bar is certainly an enjoyable place to eat. We were four in before a show and had noodles around - two ramen, two straight up: the white pumpkin ramen, ginger and scallion, one extremely hot noodles, and a pork ramen, plus the shitake mushroom buns to open. Total was about CAN$120 for four before tip, and included four drinks (only one sake cocktail). The buns are fantastic, white pumpkin got great reviews, and the hot noodles are certainly hot, but not killer (by my taste, and I'm middle of the road on heat). The Milk portion upstairs is just a fridge display with Milk items flown in from NYC. The Milk stuff is great, but it's not baked in house and you just load up with what you'd like prior to them tallying it up at your table and adding to your tab.",0,0,0,positive

My wife and I recently visted here for lunch during the week.  We both were really excited to try Momofuku ramen after watching a tv series called Mind of a Chef.  Neither of us have had ""real ramen"" before so I can't really compare it to anything else unfortunately.  

The place itself was really nice but had very tight seating.  We sat at the noodle bar and it was cramped and the seats were quite uncomforatable.  In fairness, we had spent the prior couple days walking all around the city and were sore to begin with. 

It was neat watching the chefs work the ramen magic.   That was  a fun experience in itself.  We both ordered the momofuku ramen and it came out rather quickly. The ingredients seemed very high quality.  The pork was very tender and the noodles were cooked well.  Overall however, Ithoguht the ramen was rather bland.  I'm not sure if this is typical of ramen or not but it certainly left me wanting more.  There was a sauce in the middle of the ramen that tasted really good but I made the mistake of mixing it in and then not being able to taste it.

Not only is it at least as expensive as the best ramen places in I've been in in Toronto, but it wasn't as great either (but it was good for sure!).

I am definitely a fan of the NYC location. Given the travesty that was the ramen scene in Toronto only a couple years back, there are now high expectations. It has exploded with newcomers including Sansotei, Santouka, and Kinton vying for the title of best ramen shop. 

Unfortunately, this place doesn't quite make the grade. The grade factors in location because the best ramen in North America still resides in NYC or LA. In the Toronto area, I would give the thumbs up to Santouka. And for those traveling from NYC, it isn't as good as the original noodle bar. 

First, the signature BBQ pork buns are fluffy, but poorly constructed, over sauced and the pork is somehow bland, despite fat being flavour. Some of the cuts were inconsistent.

Second, the momofuku ramen is just ok. Some nice bounce to the noodles and a good mix of fixings. The pork belly was again bland in taste and colour. The broth however, still brought some deep rich flavour. I gave some consideration to try the smoked chicken ramen as this may be a unique taste but passed.

I started with the chicken bao. It was sloppy but tasty. I had the Momofuku ramen for my main, and did enjoy it. Granted I had to down about six glasses of water to combat the MSG. 

Our server was personable and well informed. Our seat was less pleasant. Every time the front door opened, we were right in the line of a very cold draft.

Adding to the explosion of ramen bars in Toronto, we come here to the legendary Momofuku to see if its worthy of the fame that its New York location has spread.   Having gone there this summer, i was excited to try this local branch.  Delicious as it was in New York, I did find the broth too salty for my taste but was blown away by the pork buns and the mushroom buns.  

Lucky us, Momofuku delivers some of the same goodness.  I opted for the namesake ramen which comes in a shoyu (soya sauce) broth rather than the more common and fattier tonkotsu (pork bone) broth.  Perfectly poached egg perched atop a bed of noodles and surrounded by two pieces of pork belly, nori, a dollop of a spicy sweet sauce, green onions, some kimchi.  Flavourful and not too salty, the noodles had the right amount of bite and that gorgeous egg oozed its yolky goodness.

Dessert however was quite strange. I had the cereal milk soft serve with corn flake crunch. Corn flake crunch is genius. Tasted great. But the ice cream itself was not sweet whatsoever. Almost a savoury\/slightly salty tinge to it. Very very strange. Expensive too. Almost $7 for a shot glass sized portion including a 75 cent charge for the corn flake bits.

If you go upstairs to the Milk ""bar"", it's really just a big glass fridge with her (Christina Tossi's) desserts.

We ordered all the buns on the menu and they were all great. Portions are tiny and the buns are expensive. Overall, we all enjoyed the BBQ Pork bun the most. 

We all had ramen as our main course and most people enjoyed their dishes. The waitress recommended that I order the chilled noodles with black beans, spinach and cashews. The dish was incredibly weird, overly salty, and pretty disgusting. I left it mostly untouched.

I am a pescatarian, so my menu choices are limited to veggie and fish dishes. I didn't have much choice, as most of the menu items were meat-based. 

I got the Onigiri ($5) to start and the Ginger Scallion noodles ($12) as my main. The Onigiri were delicious with an umeboshi (pickled plum) paste as the dip. They were three salty and tangy round rice balls about the size of golf balls mixed with seaweed furikake (flakes) and sesame seeds, and were a fun take on the traditional way of making onigiri, which is usually triangular and seaweed-wrapped with a filling of umeboshi or fish. I was expecting the Ginger Scallion noodles to be in a broth, but they weren't. They were very good, but not as fun or flavourful as the Onigiri.

Momofuku is a different set up from what most people are probably expecting, so it might rub some people the wrong way.

The seating is communal, meaning you will probably be sitting right next to a stranger unless you've come with more than 4 people in your party. One of my friends didn't enjoy the Momofuku experience much because she is more selective about foods and had some difficulty choosing from the menu, so she was going to order dishes as she went.... and it didn't turn out so well for her. The server who took our original order never came back to check on her, and at the time we didn't realize that you have to flag someone else down and speak up in order to get service. She ended up only getting an appetizer, and the rest of us had all finished our mains, so she was still hungry when we left. It was sad, but now we know for next time.

The atmosphere is very relaxed  and casual. Even though it's busy and bustling you don't feel rushed. The food is a tad pricey but they give you good-sized portions for the mains and the quality is quite good. On the whole, I enjoyed my first experience there and would go back again (hopefully when the menu has changed and I can eat something other than Ginger Scallion noodles!).",1,0,0,positive

I've been here twice. I was pleased with both experiences.

While the food is excellent, the fatal flaw at Momofoku is the service. Being a bartender at a high-volume, fast-paced downtown restaurant, I believe I'm fairly empathetic to my server when eating out. However, it drives me absolutely bonkers how your server at Momofoku will avoid you for 7-10 minutes when you first walk in. I suppose their theory is that by then, they can swing by, greet you, and take a full food and drink order in one swoop. This is garbage. I usually want to take some time browsing my menu for food choices, and taking it all in. However, I have my drink order ready to go within a minute of sitting down. Come take the order so I at least have something to sip on while I determine what I'm eating.

Overall the service is 'just meh'. Impersonal and inattentive. I found this surprising, because before Momofoku opened, we lost alot of the servers at my restaurant to go train for Momofoku. I stayed in touch with these friends of course, and the service training regimen at Momo is intense and thorough, they said. Obviously the training isn't quite right, because the service isn't tight.

We always started with the pork buns, which are authentic, and absolutely delicious with a squeeze of Sriracha. People are complaining that they are overpriced, but thats up you to decide. It was $11 for two moderate-sized buns, which technically isn't a ton of volume, but I think the quality of this pork is the reason for the pricing. Like I said, I ordered them again on my second visit.

The first time I ordered the chilled spicy noodles (sichuan sausage, black bean, cashews). Delicious, and the cashews were an awesome touch. Bronwyn ordered a duck skin noodle (no longer on the menu) which was also delicious. It came with a big, crisp piece of skin sticking out of the middle like a flag (yum).

Second time, I got the chow mein (short rib, cheese). Almost better than the chilled spicy noodles, the flavour in this dish was huge, somewhat smokey. Plenty of rib meat too. Bronwyn got the smoked chicken ramen (garlic, miso, menma). This was also very tasty, and again, had a robust smoke-flavour (obviously).

Our other guest had the standard Momofoku ramen (both times, different guests ironically) and both said they enjoyed the dish.

All these dishes were massive, and in my opinion, well worth the price (12-15 per dish).

The beverage menu was pretty weak. Five bottled beers (one of which was canned Pabst...) and I believe 3 different wines. This area could use improvement, big time.",1,0,0,positive
87,ZWiCrgrWQ2U_kAeiUjHOZw,OHfTeAhGpJtUMEOe7QLwgw,zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ,2,2012-11-09,"David Chang, is the cult of cool in the food world! He's the chef and owner of the famous Momofuku restaurant brands, has brought his celebrity to Toronto and I, like many others, looked forward to experiencing the hype and excitement around the brand and trying the famed Momofuku since it landed in the gorgeous new Shangri-La Hotel over the summer time. 

We decided to quench our thirsts on their Seven Spice sour slushy - it was a very refreshing drink with a very unusual smokiness and kick of flavour from the combination of yuzu, lime, sake and togarashi which is a Japanese chilli powder. Don't slurp it too fast or you may get a brain freeze!! 

OK so let's get to the food: 

For our appetizers, we had their pork steam buns which came almost instantly after we put in the order. Fatty pork belly served with scallion and hoisin sauce in a pillowy fresh bun. They were good but there was nothing special to it. 

For mains: 
We definitely wanted to try their signature Momofuku Ramen, it's definitely a big portion so if you're not too hungry, a group of two can definitely share it. It was a brothy bowl of chewy noodles, with pork belly, fish cake, scallions, kimchi, nori and a poached egg. The broth was subtle and a bit too bland for me. 
We also tried their chilled spicy noodles - this was a very unusual noodle bowl that came with fresh crispy spinach, candied cashews and sichuan sausages that were like little meatballs over cold ramen noodles. It was definitely spicy with the XO sauce and spices that were in the mix and we started sweating after a few crunchy bitefuls. I'm glad we tried the dish but I would definitely order something in it's place the next time around. 

Finally we did try their pear rice pudding as a dessert and this was a very unique flavour of fermented rice - rich and sticky and an odd sour but fruity aftertaste. 

All in all, this experience was just average and I think that Chang's reputation does a disservice to the restaurant as with many others, we come in with extraordinary high expectations for an amazing culinary experience and set ourselves and the restaurant up for disappointment. 

If i'm seeking comfort and am in the area, i would pop in again but I wouldn't go out of my way as there are plenty of other ramen joints around the city that foot the bill for those cravings",1,0,0,positive

I've had some great meals at the New York location, so I was happy to find there was one in Toronto when I was in town for a conference. I tend to eat sadly at these things--fast, utilitarian meals, often at lobby restaurants or chain sandwich shops--but apparently not in Toronto's Financial District. The Momofukuplex was a block from the conference hotel, and many of us attendees took advantage. I ended up going twice for lunch: first to Daish?, then to the Noodle Bar.

I wasn't actively trying to do this--I wanted noodles, but was looking to check out Toronto's Chinatown while I was in the area. But when I linked up with my vegetarian friend Sarah W. for a late lunch, Momofuku stepped up as an easy option that was worth visiting from out of town. The place has a powerful draw, and its modern noodle shop concept means it accounts for vegetarians. I was happy to see reservations were accepted, and was able to book a table online an hour in advance, for 1:45 on a Friday afternoon. Not the most difficult time to get seated.

The place was still quite busy when we showed up, though there were a few seats available at the various long communal tables (all seating here is communal, I believe). The Noodle Bar was on the ground floor of the glass cube Momofuku building, and I'm guessing it does the most business. Service was friendly and efficient, and I had a tremendously satisfying meal.

Since it had been a while since my last Noodle Bar visit, I went with classics all the way down: pork bun, pork ramen, and cereal milk soft serve. It was all excellent, the same level of in-your-face deliciousness I've come to expect from Momofuku. I've had many pork buns over the years since David Chang made them so popular, and still, none have come close to Momofuku's. These pillowy bao buns were stacked with drippingly unctuous pork belly and plenty of scallion and cucumber to cut through the fat. I asked for sriracha to pair with the hoisin sauce, and the buns were perfected. Given that I ate both by myself (Sarah got the shiitake buns and the potato dashi ramen, neatly parallel to my lunch), the pork ramen was probably overkill, coming with more of that decadent pork belly. It hit the spot, though, a hot bowl of soothing ramen on a brisk fall Toronto day, loaded with chewy noodles, pork belly, pork shoulder, fish cake, scallion, seaweed, and loose poached egg in a rich, silky broth. For dessert, I got the soft serve, the cereal milk swirled with fruity cereal milk, sprinkled with the corn flake crunch topping. Sweet and creamy, with a bit of salt and a crunch. A truly ideal dessert.

In keeping with Momofuku tradition, this Noodle Bar has a 3-star Yelp rating it in no way deserves. You all are welcome to manage your expectations, but the food here is ultra tasty. It's a great stop for a quick, casual lunch, and I'd come unhealthily often if I lived or worked in the area.",4,3,4,positive

The pork buns were a little disappointing. I definitely had a lot better elsewhere. The bun were super soggy and wet (which is understandable since they are steamed but these were a little more moist than most places) and the pork itself was kind of bland. 

As for the pork ramen, it was good\/okay, on a scale of 1-5, I would say 3.5 at the most. The broth good, the ramen was cooked nicely. Loved that they included fish cake.  Portion was good and I wasn't even able to finish my bowl.

The place was crowded, but we were seated right away. We were seated upstairs in the lounge near across from the bar and were greeted right away by the bartender and our server.

We both wanted the extremely spicy ramen. The server warned us, it was super spicy and they would not be able to take it off the bill if we don't eat it.  The server suggested that one of us get the super spicy and the other the ginger and we can share both. We took the server's suggestion.

Our food came, and the server dropped off a small glass of soy milk next to me since we were having the extremely spicy noodles. They meant business! My mom and I love spicy. These noodles were the spiciest I have tasted in my whole life. My mom decided to stick with the ginger, and I stuck with the spicy noodles. I loved that I could still taste all of the flavors with the chilies and ramen despite being extremely hot. I did take advantage of the soy milk and let the server know to keep the water coming (which she did). I managed to eat the entire bowl and it was AWESOME. I joked with a server and the bartender, that I should get a t-shirt for eating the entire thing without passing out. They agreed. I am sure there are people out there who can eat the whole thing without water or milk...God Bless em! I had a bite of the ginger ramen too which was pretty good, but I was happy with my spicy choice.

My only regret, was ordering wine with the meal, I could not taste it after having the noodles and had to wait several minutes until after I was finished with the ramen to drink it.

I went for Summerlicious. For the most part, the food is okay. It's certainly not spectacular. 

Atmosphere: Very VERY busy. Extremely crowded. Not a fun time. High ceilings were a nice touch, though.

Service: Friendly, but slow. We were told we wouldn't be seated until all members of the party arrived. This was an absolutely reasonable request. However, we ended up being seated about 20 mins after the last of our party arrived. Water was served immediately, along with drinks. No one took our food order for a good 15 minutes. The server (again, friendly) kept saying she'll be right with us, but didn't really make it all the way to our table for a while. However, food service is incredibly fast, so that's laudable. 

Food: Ordered pork belly bun, salmon crudo, ginger scallion noodles. Of the three, the bun is by far the best item, and I'd go back to have another 3 orders of it all to myself. They really cook it perfectly: the belly literally melts in your mouth, and you will miss the taste of it on your tongue. The salmon was fresh but poorly seasoned, though artfully prepared. Noodles were slippery, greasy and bland. However, the ramen was cooked perfectly. 
Dessert was truffles. Don't even bother with these. They're not worth even photographing (hence why it's not in my photos). Dry, cold, sickly sweet, a sugary smell so strong that it's reminiscent of vanillin. I ordered a cereal milk soft serve with corn flake bits instead. Much more edible, and the best reflection of Momofuku\/DChang.

Having said that, I am well aware that Winterlicious menus are typically not indicative of how a restaurant prepares food on a regular night.

But in spite of that fact, this is ramen I'm talking about.  The broth is prepared well in advance as are most of the condiments. The only things actually made to order are the meat (which was chicken thigh in this case), poached egg, and noodles, which do not require much precision to cook.

After having said THAT, this was a very disappointing ramen experience.  The broth was extremely plain, reminiscent of chicken broth, and the portion size was noticeably smaller than the small sized serving at all other ramen restaurants.

The pork bun was good as expected, but not mind-blowing as other reviews may suggest.  Yes, seared pork belly is delicious, but at the end of the day, it's JUST pork belly with hoisin sauce and green onion.  The bao was soft and balanced well with the pork and sauce, but again, nothing amazing.

Lastly, not to be outdone by the ramen, dessert was their cereal bar milk soft serve, and this was the ""cherry"" to top off a rather underwhelming tasting experience.  It's basically milk soft serve, with pureed corn flakes.  If someone told me that a child came up with this dessert idea, I would completely believe you.  This was like something a child would say they made.  Why are people paying money for this?  This is an absurd dessert.  My friend opted for the Soy Milk Panna Cotta, which was arguably worse.  The panna cotta was flavourless, and the pomelo garnish didn't improve the experience.

Overall, if you're looking for a great ramen experience, you've made a ghastly error in going to Momofuku Noodle Bar.  There are many (hell, even just one would do) other better ramen options within walking distance.  I understand that it's Winterlicious.  I also understand that Momofuku's prime location obligates them to up the price on food.  And I'm totally fine with that.  But they should ensure that their product is on par with their competition.  And at the very least, for Winterlicious, their food should pique my curiosity enough to want to return on a regular night.",2,1,0,positive

In Calgary, the best I can do is a few ""noodle bar"" concepts that are delicious, but I've never had what raised the bar.
Lo and behold a wedding in montreal brought me within close proximity of Toronto's momofuku restaurant. Sure I had to take a train, but still after barely being able to make the reservation I had my special slot to eat here.
The service at momofuku is fast paced. The servers rarely make small talk. Save for this one guy who looked at me taking a dozen pictures on my phone and ordering a whack load of food. ""Hey man do you work in the industry?"". Odd question I wanted to ask him if he an equally silly question like ""How many socks have you lost?"". Still we laughed over the abundance of food I ordered: chicken fried rice, 2 pork buns and 2 chicken buns, a pickled cucumber salad, and the RAMEN.
The steamed buns were the things dreams are made of. The pork belly melted like butter on my lips. It didn't' even make into my mouth. And the chicken? Wooo boy. The chicken fried rice was very tasty and the rice wasn't mushed up like it was all stir fried by a cook with grudge. Finally, the RAMEN. Months I've been trying to take a stab at Momofuku's recipe and could never get it right- and finally I had enough tasted for a year's worth of notes. The broth was rich and clear, the noodles firm and held moisture quite well, and the fixings were next level. This was a next level ramen, that's all I have to say.
I'm a little shocked at the reception Momofuku is receiving in Toronto. It's sad given my experience was stellar and worth the visit. I wonder if David Chang is pulling his hair? Well he shouldn't because he should pack it up and move to Calgary. WE NEED MOMOFUKU. We swim in oil and obsess about food here Dave, come set up shop, you will be well received!",6,0,1,positive

The pork bun was nice but I did not like the hoisin sauce that they put in the bun. The bun came with two big slices of pork that was pretty yummy. 

The ramen was nice but nothing special. However, it did come with a fair amount of ingredients. That being said, I have had better and cheaper ramen elsewhere. 

The cereal milk soft serve was unique. It is like soft ice-cream and the cereal taste reminded me of Horlicks for some reason. It was tasty but if I'm being honest, I think I might have preferred a McDonalds sundae. Sorry. 

Overall, I do not regret coming here. $18++ was fine for my meal but post-Summerlicious, I probably won't be returning. 

On a side note, if you're a girl wearing a skirt, I would be careful about sitting at the high tables on the 2nd level.

I called ahead to book a table for the seven of us, but this was not possible as they only accept reservations for up to 6 people. We had no choice but to go there and hope a table would free up for the seven of us. Reaching there I talked to the hostess and told her we were seven people and I was told there was no free table available and that we would have to wait for 20 min. After 20 min had passed, she told me that a table was being cleaned up and that we would be seated ""momentarily"". Another 10 min passed so I walked up to her and asked what happened with our table. This girl was snarky, gave me a mean girl look and said in a very annoyed tone of voice that she never said it would be done soon and asked me to step outside and wait. I was backed up by my friends who all said she had used the exact word ""momentarily"" about our expecting table. After another 10 min we were finally seated by this same annoyed girl. By this time we were all starving!!
The best part of this food experience was the pork bun. It was really delicious and I would love to have that again. The chicken Ramen was flavourful, however I've had tastier Ramen before so it was not a top contender. For dessert I had the dark chocolate mousse. However the mousse was very dense so I would rather refer to it as some kind of pudding. Overall with food and especially the poor customer service I give this place 2 stars. I really hope they can improve on their customer service. The hostess is the first person you meet as you step into a restaurant so you can't have a rude person greeting your customers.

I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and family and we ordered a bunch of dishes to try. The daily special was Ham and Swiss Sweet Buns with caramelized onions and they were AMAZING. We also ordered the Pork Buns, Brussels Sprouts, and Chicken Wings off the menu. The Pork Buns were tasty, and the pork was very tender and flavourful, but I still preferred the Ham and Swiss Buns. The Chicken Wings were also good, but nothing special. Now, the Brussels Sprouts blew. my. mind. I have never liked Brussels sprouts but my mom loves them, which is why we ordered them. I tried them for the sake of ""broadening my horizons"", and ended up devouring half the bowl. I would have never expected Brussels sprouts to go well with pickled apple and bacon, but it was the most delicious vegetable dish I have ever eaten. 

My parents and I all got the Dan Dan Mian with peanuts, spicy pork and dried scallops. Even though there were too many scallions for my liking, I thought it was great. My brother ordered the Momofuku Ramen, which was my second favourite noddle dish. My boyfriend ordered the Jaja Noodle which was also good, but my least favourite out of all of them. 

For dessert we split a pint of the soft serve Cereal Milk ice cream with the corn flake topping. It was delicious, and tasted exactly like a frozen bowl of cereal.

The portion sizes were teeny tiny for $14; as my brother in law mentioned, he could have had 2 bowls of better tasting ramen elsewhere for that price. $60 later, we were still hungry and drove to the closest All Star Wings.

Mushroom dan dan - I actually liked this dish quite a bit when I started eating it. The sauce was pretty good until you're half way through the noodles because all of the sauce was sinking to the bottom and it got REALLY salty. 3.5\/5

1. Salmon Crudo
habanero, green papaya, nori

Small piece of salmon, but it was reaaaaallly good. It was of a smaller portion, but great quality. 4\/5

My friend had gotten the Napa Cabbage Kimchi for her starter which was kind of sadly just regular kimchi in a bowl...

2. Southern Fried Chicken (local)
bibb lettuce, kimchi, red eye mayo

Actually really good. The server said it can be eaten with the piece of chicken taken off and rolled up in the lettuce with kimchi, dipped into the peanut sauce. It was creative and actually quite a nice piece. 5\/5 but just a bit messy :3

Ginger Scallion Noodle (vegetarian)
shiitake, cucumber, cabbage

This one was a bit .. normal though. Not hating on my friend's selections (We both wanted the chicken....) but it wasn't anything special you couldn't get in Chinatown.. and for a larger portion too. 2\/5

3. Strawberry & Chocolate Truffles
Why are the desserts the only thing I really like in all my reviews now for summerlicious?!?! Maybe I am growing a sweet tooth ... But the truffles were the best part. Not too sweet, but the outside crust ALWAYS balances with the cake-y filling. The chocolate has a bit of a coconut crust with a yummy milk chocolate cake taste ^.^ 5\/5 for both of them.

Let's begin with the ""highlight of the day"" -- Mushroom Dan Dan Mian. I feel like a camel while eating this because it seemed like salt didn't cost anything and I probably ingested a week's worth of sodium. Definitely PACKED with some salty flavours. Desperate times call for desperate measures and my friend asked for hot water in hopes of diluting the sauce. Response from our waiter: We don't serve hot water. Are you kidding me...

We thought we could end things on a better note with our soft serve because how can you mess up ice cream right? For some reason, our first reaction when we tasted the ice cream was: BAMBOO?? Except pandas probably have tasted better bamboo. After a while it started to taste like milk that has been drenched in corn flakes cereal. To each their own but not really up my alley. 

However, the BBQ pork bun and chickpea fritter bun saved themselves two stars. I think I was just relieved it wasn't packed with salt, but they weren't bad. A busy and hyped up place in my opinion. Nice decor though, pretty modern and industrial but damn those chairs are heavy.",4,4,1,positive

Okay seriously how come the Toronto one was none of that????? The noodles completely over cooked and not chewy. The broth was full of salt and didn't taste meaty. The pork belly was overcooked and fat. The other ingredients looked like crap and we're overcooked too. The egg was not poached properly. While sitting at the bar I could also see how many bowls were sent back to be fixed. 

Also how do you even screw up steaming the pork buns? The buns seemed to have sit there for a long time or just microwaved.

I was given two dishes - Shredded apple with a sauce and Camembert, and a bok choy in a salty sauce with roe.

We ordered two different ramens. 3 major flaws in both:
1) The broth had very little flavor. NOT the rich, deep, pork bone flavor that you should expect. the soup was very thin.
2) Not enough soup. it didn't even cover the noodles. It was almost like a sauce. how do you eat soupy ramen noodles without any soup??
3) The soup was even hot. it was luke warm. Again, how do you eat soupy ramen noodles, with a cold soup?

Also, ordered the rice cakes... but the serving size was insanely small. We paid $11 for a serving that was about a fistful worth of rice cakes!--it had like 20 pieces in it. That's like $0.55 per rice cake, which are each an inch long!  Crazy! It's rice for goodness sakes.

Service deserves a 1 star because I had to wait over 20 min after getting seated to just get water then another 15 min to order - this is all also sitting next to the waiter station where they fill drinks and swipe credit cards.

My first Momo experience wasn't that great because I wasn't a huge fan of the Momofuku Ramen. However, this experience changed everything and I think this will be one of my go to stops for good food in Toronto. 

We made reservations because we came on a Friday night and the restaurant can get pretty packed. I ordered the Chilled Spicy Noodle and I highly recommend this! It is a cold noodle so it isn't in a warm broth. It had some sort of black bean sauce that had a nice spiciness to it. My favourite part was the pork sausage. These little patties packed in so much flavour and it left me wanting more. There was also a small handful of spinach on top, so it gave the noodle dish a nice crispy texture. 

Like I always say, you can never finish a meal without dessert! We ordered the famous Milk Bar Soft Serve with the cereal crunch. I absolutely love this ice cream because it's really light and has more of a frozen yogurt texture to it. I think the ice cream is way too expensive though, it's around $5+ for a small cup.

I really loved the spicy clam ramen -- the broth wasn't overwhelmingly spicy but had some heat. It was kept pretty simple with just broth, clams and a health serving of noodles. My only complain that brought this review down a star is that some of the clams were sandy which was disappointing. That being said, I'd go back and order it again because the broth was just that good. The octopus was interesting and did have smoky taste, but I didn't love it. I would probably skip it next time.

First off, the noodles portion was smaller than expected. You would either need to order an appetizer or an extra portion of noodles (don't think that's an option...). 

Flavour was great. I love the innovation and fusion in the recipes that David Chang creates. I remember how impressed he was with the Tsukemen during his visit to Japan, and I was surprised and delighted to taste his creation\/version of the Tsukemen soup base. I could pick up so much soup with his noodles,  much more than I could have with traditional Tsukemen. 

For someone as innovative as he is, I thought he would have had a unique way in serving his sake. The teion sake came in a small 4 Oz glass. It would have been more interesting if it was served in a small glass, sitting in a wooden box filled with sake, the way some  restaurants in Japan would serve their single sake.

We figured that, whether we enjoyed it or not, we could say that we got to try it. The wait that night was shorter than normal, according to the host outside the door (15 minutes) so the opportunity presented itself. 

The environment inside is big and yet still fairly inviting. Lots of long tables that you share with other guests; there's a lot of noise too but it's not too intense. The crowd seemed to be Bay St. types for the most part. There's a lot of waitstaff constantly buzzing around. The service is cordial, but to the point--there were a lot of people there and I guess they want things to flow as quickly as possible. 

For drinks, we did water. I guess it's important to mention that we're not what one would call a ""high budget"" group of people, so when we're at a more expensive restaurant and the cheapest beer is $8, we usually pass. They did have an interesting selection of alcohol though, and Coca Cola from Mexico, which was more expensive than their Diet Coke. Figure that one out. 

For appetizers, we ordered the pork buns, which have some sort of cult following or something, apparently. Were they good? Sure. Were they worth $5 each? Probably not. They were unique in their presentation (an open bun with meat placed haphazardly inside, instead of the closed up ones I'm sure a lot of people are used to), and they tasted good, but afterward I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about. Perhaps it's because we split two buns among three people? 

Now onto the Ramen. All of us ordered the Momofuku ramen so I can't give you perspective on more than that. How was it? Lacking in taste, to be honest. We all put the hot sauce that was provided to us (it seemed like sriracha but I can't be sure) in our ramen to give it more flavour and spice. I don't usually mind doing that, but this particular bowl of ramen was $15. It also didn't really have that much pork in it, so the whole thing felt like it was sort of... missing something. I did like the kimchi in it though, as it gave some extra kick. 

So what's my final verdict? Let's be honest, Toronto has a lot of asian food of varying quality, but for the most part it's not all that expensive. Momofuku's Noodle Bar seems to be more about the atmosphere and the hype than the food, and its price-point is high. So if you're into that, it's great, but if you're expecting mind-blowing ramen, you may want to try elsewhere first (Manpuku, 8 minutes away, is delicious and about half as expensive).

Chef Chan, you done good. Went during Summerlicious (set menu) which my wife ordered from while I ordered a la carte:

Pork buns = Damn good. Messy...but damn good.
Beef brisket bun = Damn good.
Ginger Scallion noodle - This bowl is served vegetarian with no broth but had excellent flavour (Shitake, cucumber, cabbage, green onion).
White Kimchi - Yup.  Do this.

I asked the server what the most popular dish was.
Answer...
Pork Ramen.  I've had pork ramen in several countries and across different cities copying this trendy restaurant menu item. This however, is not a trend or an imitation of a dressed up instant ramen noodle pack.  This was authentically delicious. Those noodles...perfect. That soft boiled egg...man, that was right. That first bite of the Pork Belly...F!&#.

For those of you who want that super salty, .99 cent cheap stuff go buy it at the grocery store on your way back to the college dorm. If you want complex flavours, big chunks of pork belly, and properly done noodles in a perfectly balanced broth....eat this and eat here.

The Cereal Milk Soft Serve is exactly what the name is. Chef Chan probably finished a bowl a Cap'n Crunch and drank the milk and said ""Damn. I gotta turn this into soft serve"".  He was right. It was really good.

If you watched the Netflix show Mind of a Chef (of course you did) you probably went upstairs to the Milk Bar and bought one of those Corn Cookies.
First bite...not so sweet, not too bad. Second bite...oh yeah, I can taste the subtle corn flavour. Third bite, crack cookie.

Suggestion...PLEASE find a way to bake these cookies fresh in house and add the Cereal Milk Soft Serve to make a Corn Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich. Or just bake these suckers fresh.  I'll drive a long way for them.

Thanks for the great service.

I often feel the staff at a restaurant can make or break your experience, unfortunately from entering to exiting my service at momofuku was just unnecessarily crappy.

First - my friend and I didn't eat there, we went straight up to the milkbar--which was overrated! A tiny fridge filled with prepackaged goods. Visiting from Vancouver, I wanted a tiny souvenir, they were out of totes and pins but no clear signage confirming that. When we came back downstairs I politely asked the hostess if there were any pins left and she looked at me, then looked at me head to toe (and back again) and said without looking at my face that they were out of pins and proceeded to talk to her other hostess friend. Ok, sure. It would have been nice if she had checked the back at least.

I shrugged it off, ordered our soft serve and waited. It was a Saturday morning so to me, not busy by any means. I asked if we could sit on the empty tables and chairs right in front of us as the whole section was empty. She pointed us to two cramped seats by the window edged by a giant supportive beam and other patrons and told us ""you can sit there."" I felt it was unnecessarily rude - if she had explained that the seats were for customers eating ramen then I would understand. My friend had bought $20 worth of cookies from the milkbar but it wasn't enough to let us eat for 5 minutes (which is how long it takes to eat the soft serve because it's about as big as a Dixie cup).

I left telling some other guy working there that the girl in the grey sweater was really rude to us. We sat and ate our soft serve in the foyer of the restaurant. The experience was a total let down and the soft serve was underwhelming!",3,1,1,positive

Yes, things are a bit pricey when you look at what it is - $10 for 2 pork buns, $16 for a bowl of ramen. I am someone that looks for good value, but on taste alone, this is deserving of 4 stars.

It's a small menu but it's executed very well. The pork is deliciously fatty.... I loved it! The ramen noodles were delicious, though I found the broth a bit rich. The chicken has great crispy skin and tenderly cooked.

I came here on the Friday after they opened - Day 3 of operation, and I was impressed by the efficiency of the staff. I sat on the bench facing the kitchen and had full view of the well oiled machine this restaurant already operated. While there was a line up at lunch time, the servers went swiftly through it, taking down names and phone numbers and promising to text when a table is ready, so you don't need to wait around. Much appreciated. I got the text about 30 min later, and when I got there, i was promptly seated.

Overall I think the price will not deter people from coming here, especially considering the area its in. And I am looking forward to returning for another pork bun. Yum.",2,1,1,positive

Came here for dinner w\/ a friend. The noodle bar doesn't take reservations unless you pre-order the fried chicken (12 pc)...which happens to cost $40.  I'm not sure what's so special about this, but it's  apparently their signature dish.
Anyway, we ordered the pork buns ($10 for 2 pce). Though it seemed a bit pricey, there were two decent sized pieces of pork belly in each bun, and they were cooked perfectly and of good quality.  I think this is the only thing I was really impressed by.
Ordered the Momofuku Ramen - again the meat was of good quality and cooked well, the noodles were good.  However, the broth was the strangest ramen broth I've ever tasted.  It had an artificial ""smoked"" taste, and seemed to be chock full of some sort of soy sauce or something of the like... it had almost a weird sour \/ salty taste to it.  Epic fail. 
The grilled squid was meh - server told us it is a popular dish but it wasn't that special.  Not sure if it was supposed to served luke warm or not, but that's how it came.  In fact, even the ramen was not piping hot.

I'm glad I've had the chance to try this place - given all the hype and excitement that came with the opening of it in Toronto, I knew it was a place I'd try at least once.

I came from Vancouver and had a lot of expectation for Momofuku since David Chang has so much buzz. It was a Friday evening and the place looks lively. I ordered the Pork Buns, because it is famous. Also ordered the Pork Ramen, figured that it is their main dish and I should start with that one. I can always come back for the other items if I like them. Also ordered an IPA.

Well, the pork was decent, I think the source ingredient is pretty high quality - you can taste it. The seasoning was just hoisin, which was fine, if simplicity is that they are looking for. I wish there were a bit more depth, but it was decent overall. You will find that this is a recurring theme. 

The pork of the bun is what it is - Pork belly with hoisin. And that's the whole thing - on a bun with more hoisin. This is actually fine, albeit lacking some depth. If I only ordered this, I would have rated Momofuku 3.5 stars.

Then there is the $16 ramen. Same pork belly, some shredded pork that tasted the same as the pork belly (with less fat), and a poached\/super soft boiled egg. It is really underwhelming. The broth was a shoyu broth, and a muddied one. The problem is not the fact that it is shoyu, or that it is not clear. It just has a lack of identity. You either want your ramen broth to have lots of depth in flavor, and maybe really rich (Tonkotsu\/miso\/certain shoyu), or go the other way and makes it really clean and refine (shio\/shoyu similar to ichiran). Now this broth is really one-dimensional - it is not a clean broth, it is not a rich broth, it is not a favorful broth - it is just a pork broth.

A well-cooked ramen, no matter how you innovate it, will give you the desire to drink all the broth. I didn't even finish this ramen, cuz the broth is so underwhelming and has a lack of identity overall. The noodle is ok I guess? the problem is that ramen noodle needs to chosen to match the broth. That's why different ramen broth calls for different noodles. The broth has no direction, so the noodle is also just... noodles.

My beer also came at the end of my meal, but that's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. They have bigger issues. 

It was an expensive $16 bowl of noodle with zero souls. If I move this chain to Vancouver, the ramen wouldn't even top 10 ramen in Vancouver.

The ramen was just as disappointing. It was confused, over-spiced, too salty, and the egg was so raw it broke as soon as I tried to pick it up with my spoon. The corn ramen is a mistake.

The noodle dish was nice but just lacking in a few different areas. Immediately, I felt the portion size was a bit on the smaller side. The noodles were cooked really nicely and had a great texture to them but I wish there had been more with additional broth as well. The broth was very rich and savoury. It packed a lot of umami flavour. The shitake mushrooms were also quite tasty, but I felt that the dish could have used an additional ingredient or two to give it a touch more substance beyond the green onions which imparted some great flavour. There were crunchy flakes on top of the noodles that didn't really add much in terms of texture or flavour in my opinion.

Momofuku ramen: interesting broth that's unlike any you can get in Toronto. The flavour is a mixture of different broths and to me, the predominant flavour is chicken followed by pork and a faint hint of seafood  umami maybe from the seaweed. It's not too salty and the noodles are firm and chewy which I like. The highlight is the amazing peppered pork belly that melts in your mouth. The other accompaniments are nice: kimchi, egg, some type of pepper purée, pulled chicken. The major flaw is that it is nowhere near hot enough. There should be near boiling soup under the fat and steam rising from the bowl as you turn the noodles. Worth it for the belly that's unlike other shops here but quite pricey.

Roasted rice cakes. Nicely cooked with a crunchy exterior but nothing special. By nature it's flavourless and it's a vehicle for the sauce which is predominantly gochujang. Pretty pricey for what you get but that's consistent with everything here.

Pork buns. See the many reviews. You can really taste the quality of the meat. Bun is soft and the hoisin and veg tastes like what you can get at any Peking duck restaurant.

Unfortunately, the reputation from New York did not translate to Toronto.

For a place that sells Ramen as one of their main items, their noodle is by far the worst compare to the other 3 I have been to in downtown: Santouka, Sansotei and Kinton.  Momofuku's biggest problem with their ramen is they add too many non-traditional toppings into their noodle, i recall seeing toppings such as Kimchi and this sauce shaped into a small egg (you can see it in the middle in the photo).  Soup based also tasted a little weird and being salty and spicy due to the ginger and kimchi.

Their second well-known item is the Pork Belly Bao!  The Pork Belly Bao on the other-hand is very good, the pork belly is very tender and the sauce added inside the bao makes the overall bao tastes very delicious!!

Environment wise, the decoration is much more modern than other the ramen places in downtown and as usual, the place is loud, but I am cool with that,

The ramen was just okay. A bit too salty for my preference and the dish came out a bit too quickly to have, or seem to have been prepared without much thought or care. While I know that soup will have been pre-made, the dish did seem slopped together and tasted so.

A bit of a disappointing experience, Momofuku is not a repeat for me.",6,1,1,positive

I heard that momofuku wasn't up to par compared to the other ramen houses in Toronto.. But it's not even worth it for the price at all. This is the only ramen place I've ever been to that doesn't let you add extra egg, pork belly, noodle, etc. My extra really spicy noodle had no flavour.. And no meat.. And it was 13 dollars. If you pay more you expect a decent meal or some actual meat and it was just gross. It was like they literally poured sirarcha on the meal and stir fried it was ramen noodles. The only decent thing was the pork buns and the corn cookie. But the crack pie was way too sweet and the double double ice cream was way too sweet. Overall this place was pretty garbage. My instant noodle at home taste more satisfying and didn't come up to 115 dollars for 3 people. If you love ramen, don't come here!!! Some mama instant noodle will be 100x better. Hell, if you just want some food that you can actually eat don't come here.

Let's not get started on customer service. This is a ''high class'' place in the financial district but they're not even that attentive or fast. They put us next to the door, where the wind kept blowing and we had a baby with us. We told them before hand we had a child with us and the baby was coughing. Our waitress seemed nice enough but not the service you expect at a higher end place. 

Overall super disappointing.",3,2,2,positive

Chicken meatball bun - Delicious.  The bun has such great texture.  It was soft and fresh.  Wish they served a bread basket just with the bun lol

Chai cheesecake - This is more like a cheesecake smoothie.  Very average.

I don't think it's cheap, but I think I got fair food for the price compared to other Ramen places. It's only fair to compare all these ramen places against each other given they are all starting around same time. I went to another one earlier this week.

At Momofuku, the portion was definitely bigger than the other two I recently went to. The Momofuku ramen also had two meats in there, the pork belly and some pulled pork. That's something that the other two did not have. So given these two things, putting a larger price isn't so bad.

The one feature of this ramen is really the egg. I was amazed how this poached eggs withstood pressure from my chopstick. I didn't try to puncture, but I was really trying to see what made it move around so easily as not to break. I don't know what it is. But what I like about eggs usually in ramen is i eat a bit of it, eat some noodles, then come back to it. But this one, since it was poached, I had to eat it immediately.

I don't think the broth is bad, but it definitely wasn't as good as some others.

I went on a Friday night, and didn't really have to wait. I guess the place is bigger with more seats, so didn't have the same wait anymore.

I also had this rice pudding with apple and black sesame cookie. The cookie was nice, the apple was nice in the pudding, but I like the pudding to be a bit my milky. The consistency was a bit odd in my opinion, kinda soft but not too soft.

I'd say this is like America's version of Ramen, bigger and more salt.",0,0,0,positive

I was looking forward to trying this place out. After a friend said it wasn't anything special, I wanted to see for myself.
#1- had a small size-alcoholic beverage that came in the smallest glass I've ever seen, and with the biggest straw. I felt like I ordered a kids drink!
#2 - the app I had was the lamb buns. It had a very sandy like texture to it, not sure if they ground up sand in with the lamb, but it was quite gross.
#3 - for the main me and my friend decided to order something different, and our waitress said the ""fried chicken"" is the best. So for $45 we got a whole fried chicken with a bit of ricotta cheese and caviar on it. I wish I had taken a picture of how it was presented, it was really bad. So we started to dig into it, and it had no flavor and the skin\/batter was way over done, dry. So after looking around to get a manager over for what seemed like forever, I finally stopped one of the staff and asked to speak to him.  When he came over I wanted to laugh at his attire and a bright orange hat, maybe that was a sign he was the manager. So after complaining about the chicken to him, he just took our plates and didn't say anything, not apologizing and not offering anything instead! 
Next he came by with the bill. The regular bill with nothing discounted for the 2 bites of the gross  $45 chicken we ate! So I called him over again, and he said he would have to ask ""the chef"" to see if the chicken should be discounted.
I was so pissed off!!! I'm not sure what I would of done if he didn't discount anything!
SO at the end of it they took care of everything, but OMG am I never going there again.

I didn't try the chicken, but both of the pork buns were excellent with lots of meat and seasoned well.  We also got a round of okonomiyaki which is really good and really hard to find at restaurants around here.  My husband and I got the Momofuku Ramen (pork) and it was also excellent.  Very tasty, lots of noodles a nice slice of pork, and a soft poached egg to mix into the broth.  The seasoning is very good, especially the topping you mix in.  One brother got the chicken ramen and he said it was really good.  The other brother and his father got the spicy clam ramen and they both liked it but said it was extremely hot and almost hotter than they could take. For dessert we had the crack pie ice cream with corn cereal topping which everyone loved.  Things that kept it from 5 stars were the wait to get in despite having a reservation and the small menu.

The experience was disappointing. Question. If Chang is from Toronto, would we even be talking about Momofuko? I do have to wonder if Chang even understands the basic concept of a bowl of noodle. Broth is hot for the noodle to absorb its flavour. Vietnamese noodle bowls fan out to let the heat escape because rice noodle softens quickly. Ramen noodle bowls don't because the noodle is thicker. Perhaps he should take a break from his experimentations and start learning the basics. (And to think that with all the experimenting, its all pretty basic traditional stuff on the menu. Hmmm....) I simple don't get the outrageously large bowl with a tiny bit noodles. I'm no food critic, foody or chef but I sure llove food. T.O. is filled with great places to eat (fusion food that really works) and I personally don't think Momofuko is up to par. Their signature noodle was way too salty. (Was that the experiment?) The noodle itself was good. Had a nice crunch. Had their octopus side. Was ok. Bland. The calamari tentacle lettuce wrap was great to look at but Very Chewy and Difficult to eat due to the large finger size tentacle pieces and the lack of utensils! Lastly, if I want kimich from a jar, would go to the market. As for the decor, the best thing is the sculpture outside. The furniture is hard, cold and uncomfortable not to mention potentially dangerous. Overall, the food and decor is good to look at with no substance. I've had more deservingly expensive noodle bowls and is more than willing to pay for it if it's Goode but this is way overpriced for the wasted time. It's definitely not the worst place to eat in TO but certainly not a place worth all the hype as it has. 

Is the experiment to see how much water one can dose down to counter dehydration from the salt, or see if one's heart can handle all the fat from the pork and salt from the broth at once? Hmmm. No thanks. 

Does well balanced mean mixing hot and cold broth to have it Luke warm or the ability to eat your noodles in the way oversized bowls?

My 3 yr old was very creative with her overly salty, red wine vinegar based cookies but that didn't make them good.

If fast food chains can run their kitchen efficiently, I do as least expect Momofuko to, given their menu is very short and simple, kimchi from jars, and nothing served hot.",1,0,0,positive

Let me tell you this, i don't give a damn how good your food is, but when you have a Host that thinks his KAKA don't stink and you have a server who has the personality of a pet rock, there are other places i would choose to go to and after my dining experience here at NoNoScrewYou Noodle Bar, i will never ever set my Hawaiian Feet in a place where the service is as cold as the Shave Ice we serve here in Honolulu.

 The Momofuku Ramen: Fifteen dollars for this? To me, it was nothing short of spectacular or earth shattering but it was just ok to say the least. I've had Ramen ten times better than this in Hawaii and at a fraction of the price. 

 Chicken Tan Tan: Once again. nothing to make you do The Happy Dance. As for the Fourteen dollar price tag on such an ordinary dish, i would rather see chicken's get their groove on and pay for the price of admission.

 Cereal Milk Ice cream: AKA McDonald's Soft Serve sprinkled with Cornflakes. I got all worked up for this??

 As for the service here, you know even if the food isn't up to snuff, service with a smile goes a long way and that will always leave a lasting impression on me. But the service here from the host and the server were somewhat stoic if not ice cold. Does David Chang teach you people not to crack a smile or even a simple hello will do. Or is David Chang going to prod you in the arse with his chopsticks if you do greet someone with a smile or even say Hello to your diners that are shelling out big bucks to try these underwhelming and overpriced noodle dishes?

 All i can say is that it's one and done for me in any Momofuku establishment. Once again, people are flocking there because of the name and i just don't understand the concept. And if you are willing to shell out eighty dollars for chicken, then i guess you are a fool.",10,13,5,negative

The noodle bar is communal style, with large tables shared with other people, and bar stools. It can be a bit cramped. I also did not enjoy being seated at one of the stool spots as it was basically facing a wall. It reminded me of eating at Salad King.  

Service was efficient and as expected for the cafeteria style. They did try to bring us pork buns twice - shouldn't have notified them of their error. 

The menu is limited and pricey. I was hoping for more ramen choices. $10 for the buns. $15 or so for a noodle bowl! We tried the pork buns and they were OK. They taste very similar to Peking duck (oddly) - it must be the sauce. The pork  was more fatty than I would have liked. My main was the Momofuku pork ramen. Again, the pork was more fatty than I would have liked, as in you bite into it and it's mostly soft liquid fat. There was some meat in the corner that I wasn't too sure about. The soup base was ok but by no means savoury. The noodles had good consistency. The presentation was good. Overall though, the flavours in the bowl did not mesh well.  

Overall, I can't say I was impressed and don't understand the hype. Perhaps their dine in spot is better.

We arrived around 11:45AM, just 15 minutes before it opened and there was already a wait list.  Luckily we received the text notifying us our table was ready, this only only another 15 minutes in the lounge upstairs (perfect view for people watching and to see how the whole kitchen operates!).  My friend and I already knew what we were going to order which was the Momofuku ramen, the pork buns and the smoky chicken wings.  The appetizers came amazingly fast.  The pork buns were tasty, moist bun, well spiced pork belly and a small swipe of hoisin sauce.  I would have prefered slighly thicker slices of cucumbers...it was lacking the crunch factor.  The smoky chicken wings were well seasoned and glazed.  I really enjoyed the smoky flavour and the hint of chili pepper spicyness.

When the ramen arrived, it was presented very prettily and you could clearly distinguish all the different toppings in the bowl.   However, when it came to taste, we were disappointed with the broth.  As other yelp reviewers have mentioned, the broth had no flavour.  It had colour but lack any taste.   The broth should have been the highlight of the bowl of ramen itself.   The toppings were decent.  I was surprised the nappa cabbage tasted like it was soaked in an asian cooking wine.  

Perhaps, David Chang should try opening one of his Milk Bar's in Toronto.   I think it would fare much better considering it's uniqueness.

Ramen bars are becoming ubiquitous and competition is ramping up, so would I come here again, probably not.  It is overpriced food combined with a less than stellar experience.",1,0,1,positive

The restaurant's entrance is stunning to be honest. I can't pretend to tell you what that sculpture is supposed to be out front, but I was incredibly impressed. Once you walk into the restaurant the interior doesn't disappoint either. It has a great modern look, so much so that I forgot my usual annoyance of not have chairs with back rests.

For the fried chicken dish we were seated on the first of four floors; the Noodle Bar. Despite having the chicken on the way, we started with pork buns as an appetizer. This turned out to be a winner choice. The bun itself was oh-so soft, a little moist, and delicately flavoured. It really let the pork belly meat control the show, and you bet it did with the amount of fat that they left on it. It also has hoisin, scallion, and cucumber.
Then came that chicken. You have to pre-order this dish a couple days before, since they pre-prep two whole fried chickens. They serve one up good old fashion souther style, then they get adventurous with a Korean style version. To complete the experience it comes with freshly made scallion pancakes, and an array of toppings so that you can make your own wraps. (Toppings: ginger scallion sauce, jalapeño garlic sauce, pickled vegetables, radishes, herbs and tabasco salt)
Here's what you need to know. Both styles were perfectly cooked. The southern style was a comforting reminder of fried chicken that you're used to done at, or near its best, and the Korean style took you to a sweet and savoury place that you didn't know you were going, but were so glad you went. And talk about crispy skin! God knows how they got that meat so soft and that skin so crackly.

The meal is meant to serve a group of 4-8 people, but I'd say if you're going with a group of genuinely hungry grown folk who are ready to eat, you can make it with 3 like we did. Don't expect to look pretty though while you work on this feast. You pay for the entire meal as a table which comes to $125 before tax.
So, was it the best chicken that I'd ever tasted? Not sure about that, but it was damn close, and the whole experience commands a 5 star rating. I'd be more than happy to try out more of Momofuku.",1,1,2,positive

We tried the pork buns, Momofuku Ramen, Chilled Spicy Noodle and Smoked Chicken Wings.  Overall, the food was very good, but nothing extraordinary, although I must confess that I am not a Ramen expert by any means.  If I could, I would probably give them 3.5 stars.  Both my dining mates said they would it only 3 stars...tough crowd!

Here's the play-by-play:
-Pork buns: fatty pork with hoisin sauce and cucumbers served on a rice bun (shaped like a pita).  Pork was nicely cooked and cuts were nice and fatty.  Rice bun was perfect - soft, fluffy and warmed.  The sauce and veggies tied it all together nicely.
-Momofuku ramen, which came with a perfectly poached egg, pulled pork, two sheets or nori and an assortment of other ingredients.  The egg and a smokey pickled cabbage were the highlights for me.  None of the other ingredients blew me away and my entire party felt that the broth was a tad bland.
-Chilled spicy noodle: This was the highlight of our meal!! Chilled ramen is served with ground pork, carmelized cashews, raw spinach, black beans and other goodies
-Smokey Chicken Wings:  These were disappointing.  They were plump and well-cooked with a nice sweet glaze, but missing any semblance of smoke.  Maybe I've eaten too much and my tastebuds don't register they smoke.  Unclear.  
-Drinks-wise, we tried the Seven Spices Slushee, which was super interesting.  It definitely had kick and tang as well as a great smooth slushee consistency.  It wasn't overly icy, which I find to be the downfall of many slushees. 
-Oh, there are no desserts...so it's definitely a noodle bar!
-The service was polite and efficient, especially considering it was their first day open.  The front of staff managed flow well, although he gave me a hard time for not receiving a text message telling me that my table was ready.  It seemed weird that I would need to check my phone considering I was standing inside the restaurant.   It's a signal that we're over-reliant on technology!

The reviews for Momofuku Noodle Bar are skewed towards the negative, and I'm here to try to right this ship. This palatial glass fortress of food is worth fighting for! 

Was this the case of other people not wanting to love it to seem cool in the wake of some other negative reviews? Did they just get off to a rocky start? I don't know, but I do know that I had one of the best meals I've had in ages here the other night. 

My small group was quite tipsy, but that didn't stop our waiter from treating us like royalty. We had sparkling wine and beers, and then hit the food hard. Pork buns, noodles, sprouts, and chicken and caviar. The chicken wasn't for me, because I'm just not a sweets person and it was drunk on maple, but the rest of the food was complete perfection. 

Lastly, I'd just like to note that there are a lot of comments like ""not as good as NYC"" listed here, and I think that's bunk. I appreciate the comparisons, but it sounds more like you're showing off for being well-traveled, because plate for plate the ingredients here are fresher and more plentiful. At first I questioned this was just my allegiance to the crown rearing it's pointed head, but I was dining with two buddies from New York, and they echoed my sentiments.

I have to say, I was pretty happy with my experience. First, drinks: not overly impressive cocktail options, but they were decent. I had the gin and tonic - no complaints.

Then ordered the shiitake buns, kimchi and lamb buns to start. I've seen a few complaints on here that the kimchi is too bitter or too sweet, but it seems like they've worked out the kinks because it was excellent in my opinion, as were both sets of buns (though the lamb was a bit salty).

I had the very spicy noodles as a main. They were awesome. Not for the faint of heart, because they actually are quite hot (duh). I ignored the waiter's warning about this, however, and was glad that I did. Note: they supply some iced soy milk on the side to help cut the heat.

I finished my meal with (a number of) cookies, which the waiter brought down from the milk bar upstairs. I'm not fat, I swear. Anyway, I wasn't too impressed by any of the flavors, but that might have been because I was already quite full by that point. I would recommend giving something else a try.

I've had me some good ramen.  I went to that place in Tokyo where you exit at the astro boy station, face the mural, turn right, look to your left until you see an alley with a black tarp, find the bone on the tarp, go inside, and have the best ramen ever.  I like that - I also like cheap ramen.  The thing is... this just wasn't for me. 

And that's why I'd probably not have ramen there again.

That being said - their BBQ pork buns?  They're $9.00 for two tiny little things - this is ""rich people food"" where the more you pay, the less you get...  but my lord were they good.  I'm notoriously, shall we say - frugal - but I would go pay those prices again for those delicious mouth fulls.

As a starter, we ordered the jar of kimuchi. I have had better kimuchi for half the price. For my main, I ordered the chicken ramen. Once again, for half the price, I've had better ramen.

But in the real world, where all you really care about is how good the food taste, Momofuku will provide you with an underwhelming and uneventful dining experience. 

Drawn by the reputation of David Chang, my friend and I decided to try this place out after work. The service was prompt, but also a bit too quick and impersonal. Given the amount of people that were waiting at the door I don't blame them. However, the waiters seemed to be a bit disorganized. Three different waiters came and repeated the same special of the night to us. They weren't the friendliest bunch either, giving us the impression that they just want us to devour our food and clear the table. 

We ordered the pork buns, onigiri and ramen noodles. The pork buns were the best thing we had that night, the pork belly was very nicely done, the texture was amazing and the hoisin sauce added a great flavour to it. The onigiri (Japanese rice balls) was delicious also, for $5 you get three onigiri in a bowl, mixed with sea weed, sesame seeds and some sort of sweet & sour sauce. 

Now, the main course is what we thought would blow us away: the Momofuku ramen. Unfortunately, it was wildly disappointing. The broth wasn't nearly as flavorful as I expected. In fact it was a bit too salty for my taste. The egg was not fully cooked, which was a letdown for me. The fish cake and the noodles tasted like the average ones you can buy from any Asian grocery store, nothing special there. It felt more like a glorified version of instant noodle, the kind that you would make when you feel lazy, by just throwing in egg, sea weed, veggies, fish cakes, etc.

I came here  a couple of years ago with friends because  they were very keen on trying the ramen and I wanted to try out some of momofukus innovative dishes . They got the ramen and did not enjoy  it . I stayed clear of the Ramen because I had seen the reviews  ( quite bland with excess  seaweed + its safer to go to a place that specializes in Ramen) and decided i would research the menu and go for something delicious worth my $

Now with Momofuku Noodle Bar  , you have to know  that they will serve food that is a fusion of almost anything using mostly Canadian  products . 

Based on my research I had gotten 
Smoked chicken wings with  pickled chili, garlic, scallion
Chilled Spicy Noodles  with  sichuan sausage, spinach, cashews
Pork Buns with hoisin, scallion and cucumber

These dishes were very good . The wings  had a nice spice to them that made u feel it but did not burn your mouth
The  Noodles were also spicy in a good way but the coldness  of the noodles was interesting and I liked it. 
The Pork buns were  soft  as was the pork meat and it was good to eat on an autumn or winter day . 



The service  was a bit hurried but  effective  as they are a very  busy restaurant.

VERY disappointed that their ice cream machine was broken :( My friend said it was mediocre and IKEA ice cream was better (LOL) but still wanted to try it for fun. Tried the compost cookie (made with pretzel, coffee, butterscotch, choco chips) and the crack pie. People rave about the pie, but to be honest, I liked the cookie better. The crack pie is decent but not worth the $6.

Came out to be $45 after tax for 2 ramen + pork buns. The cashier didn't charge us for the crack pie and cookie! Not sure why but they said ""okay I'll take care of it"" haha very nice of them to do that :)

Would definitely come back for pork buns. And to try that cereal ice cream cone.",0,1,0,positive

The pork bun was nothing special - a bao bun with pork and hoisin sauce, cucumber and scallions. 
The hot & honey chicken wing was a bit more spicy than sweet. It was crispy and complimented the sweet pork bun really well.
The clam noodle was okay - ramen noodles with clams, a lot of chopped scallions, chopped chilies and a bit of broth\/sauce to bring it all together. 
The milk cereal soft serve was unique - it literally tastes like cornflake soaked milk, which I personally find kinda gross. Who likes soggy cereal?

Today I decided just to run out to Momofuku for lunch. No reservations. I called but the long winded answering machine turned me off and in any event it said they were experiencing a high call volume. I don't know what prompted me, with all the aforementioned information to still walk 3 blocks in heels to ""see"" if I could get a table. 
I got there at about 12:00 PM. exactly - zero wait time. table for one ended up being at the bar, which was fine. There were coat hooks under the bar, but having a long coat, my coat brushed the floor and I had to give dirty looks to my neighbouring diners not to kick my coat or get their dirty shoes up on it.

Anyways, the service was tough to call because everyone is wearing street clothing so I didn't know who was who, but I got familiar soon enough as I saw someone pouring water into glasses.

Service was good thereafter as I identified who was who. 
I had the pork bun - absolutely amazing. Soft fresh bun, soft fresh pork. Local pork as well. Delicious hoison sauce.

I had the Chicken Ramen - a little bit thick broth. Possibly too much inside. poached egg was the highlight but it was sort of cold. Chicken, again, locally sourced was mouth watering good. I felt they could have served the dish a bit hotter, as when the dish is lukewarm is doesn't work as well as piping hot. Noodles were a little tough. but good overall.

Thanks to yelp and wanting to spoil myself a little, I got the chocolate pudding instead of the compost cookie. The chocolate pudding was a milk chocolaty treat, with little beads of chocolate on top and a little crumble or two of the compost cookie so I got to try it anyways.

Overall, the service was great. I was always checked on. The food was very good. I just came back to office from the restaurant so I have to think a bit more if I was impressed by the novelty or if the food was really that good. It was simple, tasty, you could taste the quality.

If you are looking for a classic ramen, this is not the place for you. Although something resembling a classic ramen is offered on the menu, you are much better off going to an actual Japanese-run ramen place (Kinton, Hokkaido Santouka, Isshin, etc.). What's worth trying here though are the other non-typical flavours. I had the white pumpkin ramen and it was uniquely tasty. Noodles were cooked to the right level of doneness in order to maintain the texture of the noodles. I may come back to try some of the other flavours or the tsukemen.

My other gripe with this place--although it should not come as a surprise--is that the servings are rather small. Compounding with the fact that the prices here are generally higher than any other noodle place, the value of a meal here is really questionable. So beware, you are definitely paying a premium for ""coolness"" here.

The hotel is pretty chic and the space for Noodle Bar is pretty swank with its high ceilings, bench seating around the edges and windows as well as tables that look like they would double for communal seating.

The food wasn't bad at all.  I mean I ordered the ramen and a banh mi special they had going that day.

The banh mi was the first to come out.  I love the wonder bread type bun that these things come out in.  They're pretty delicious.  The meat was made with head cheese, some pickled veggies and a mayo that had a nice bit of spice to it.  I really enjoyed it.

What makes ramen?  The broth obviously!  When I tried the broth it was a tag salty but from the reviews they seem everywhere but consistent.  Also it's not as good as the broth in NYC.  Is it just me?  My noodles were cooked slightly long but the other ingredients in it were pretty awesome as well as the poach egg.  It was good but with a much higher price tag (probably incurred with being in the Shangri La) there are better options in TO.

The staff were super friendly and always making sure my drink was topped and helped me through the menu when I had a few questions.  At no time did I feel like they wanted me out of there, they just wanted to ensure I was always well topped up.  I enjoyed the service for sure.

Firstly, this place is basically in the lobby of the Shangri-la hotel which is a huge vibe kill. It does not match the aesthetic of the brand at all, being jammed into a glass box into a lifeless financial district. The food was adequately prepared, but seriously lacking what I have come to expect from the vision of David Chang. The service was pretty poor, they were very busy but still...our servers alternated between three different people, none of which seemed intent on doing a professional job. Even the customer next to us had the manager brought over to his table so he could complain ad nauseum. And it was brutal. The customer was a dick. But the sad thing is, he was right. And the manager just couldn't wait to get him out of there. 
If the manager took the complaints as feedback, he could work on creating a better environment but it was clear he was just over it. Dude, this place felt like a nightclub which is a BAD LOOK.

Ordered BBQ pork buns, ramen(forgot which one) and rice cakes to share between the two of us. Surprised that the wait for the rice cakes was so long. The food itself was pretty average. The only thing we finished was the BBQ pork buns. Would definitely recommend other places for ramen because it was just not that memorable and other places do it much better. The rice cakes had a kick but there wasn't much else to them.. We didn't end up finishing them nor did we finish the soft serve. I had higher expectations since I enjoyed Daisho upstairs so much before. 
Best thing about this food outing was the iced tea.. So much so that we ended up spending $20 on. 

Finished our meal around 9:45. Took a while to flag down a server to give us the bill and took a while before we could flag them down for the debit\/credit machine.

My first experience with momofuku was actually 3 years ago in NYC, people kept raving about how awesome it was and that it was a must go to places to try out! I found the ramen broth there to be quite salty, so I was hesitant to try it again when it opened in Toronto. When I tried the ramen here, I found the broth to be quite bland..total opposite from the one I had in NYC. Not to mention, it was quite expensive for a bowl of mediocre ramen.

Anyway, so fast forward to last weekend..my boyfriend wanted to try the ramen here..even after I told him about my experience. So we went on a Saturday evening, surprisingly we didn't even have to wait! We were quickly led to a table and my bf ordered the momofuku ramen $16, I wanted to try the Dan Dan mian but they didn't have it so I ordered the smoked chicken ramen $15, and the pork belly baos $9 for 2.

I thought the same exact thing and scoffed at the idea of getting anything but poutine while on a recent visit to Ontario, but boy was I thrown for a loop when I discovered the Momofuku in the Great White North trumps anything you'll find in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Call it the terroir of a North American city not located in the United States, but hot damn did this experience blow away anything I've experienced here on David Chang's home turf.

Everything that came our way - from the pork buns to the noodles to the Japanese yams - made me wish I could lift this restaurant and each of their cooks\/servers up and bring them home with me to the city. The pork buns were flavorful, plump, and had more pork than any Momofukus here, the jaja noodles were equally as impressive, and the okonomiyaki (Japense yams) were absolutely perfect. The only miss was the fried chicken and caviar which was entirely too sweet and quite expensive ($80 for 1\/2 chicken), but I can't say we weren't warned as our server made more than a subtle hint that we should order the roasted pig head instead. We'll take that on the chin as he was 100% correct - it was quite forgettable. 

Speaking of servers, our guy Gobin was an absolute rockstar and should set the standard for servers everywhere. Amazingly attentive, kind, prompt, and knowledgable... it was an absolute pleasure spending our evening with him.

For those locals reading this - you're getting a far superior version of Momofuku than we've got here.

When I first saw Dan Dan Mein on the menu I was superrrr excited, it is one of my favourite dishes when done well, but so far I have not found a good place in Toronto for this dish. A good Dan Dan Mein is PACKED with flavor, has a nice spicy kick complemented by the richness of the ground pork and the crunch of nuts (usually peanuts). While the Dan Dan Mein here has the nice nut crunch for texture, it seriously is lacking in flavour in every other aspect, from the acidity from preserved vegetables that is supposed to be in this dish to a more spicy kick traditionally from szechuan peppercorns, the ground pork used was also too lean for me, hence did not provide the richness of flavour. I am not saying that they need to be traditional, since it is momofuku, but I expected the essence of the dish to be preserved and reinterpreted in a creative way. Needless to say, I found this dish here rather bland and disappointing. My husband also tried it and felt the same, he is commenting from an overall dish perspective (he tried Dan Dan Mein once and don't really have preconceived expectations of this dish). I guess the good thing in this dish is that the noodles were not overcooked.

The Smoked Chicken Ramen though is pretty good and interesting. We really liked the intense unami obtained from the black mushroom and chicken based broth, the crunch of the fried chicken skin, the moist chicken (which was moist but lacked a bit of flavour), the nicely cooked noodles and the poached egg. It is definitely different from the norm of regular ramen, but the essence of comfort food in ramen was maintained. Nice dish.

Overall, the noodles dishes are ok, oh one more thing that I really did not like about the noodle dishes here, I found the temperature of the noodle dishes to be warm to lukewarm when served. On a cold day, I like really hot (in temperature) dishes, especially when it comes to ramen or noodle soups. Portion sizes are on the smaller side and they cost about $14-$15 per ramen, but I expect that, due to its location and name, so I did not weigh this as a negative for this review.

The pork buns are also pretty nice here, same as the momofuku pork buns in NYC but maybe just that the slice of pork belly is smaller in Toronto. The slice of pork belly is rich and tender, served with hoisin sauce and chives inside a pillowy soft bun, yums.

The overall vibe of the place is casual, with communal table type seating and long bar table like seating (duh, noodle BAR). Service is fast and efficient. Overall, a 3 due to the creativity exhibited by some of the dishes and the yummy pork buns.",1,0,1,positive

To start off my disclaimer is that I'm rating this place on the food and service and not on the prices.  I know it's something that I usually hold in high regard namely value or ""bang for the buck"" but this place as far as I am concerned will be an exception and I will explain why.

This is not your ordinary type of establishment as far as the Toronto food scene goes.  Yes we have a lot of places to eat, we have a lot of Asian restaurants and yes we have our fair share of upscale establishments.  

Momofuku's roots are from NYC which is arguably the hardest place to thrive as far as competition goes for restaurants but as the song goes if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.  Anywhere else in this case would only be Sydney and Toronto.  Take into consideration that this multi-level restaurant complex in Toronto is the only one of its kind of all the Momofuku eateries.  Because this is a completely different experience you simply won't find just anywhere, you can expect things such as the prices and expectations to be different than just any other place in TO.

I had reserved for 4 and pre-ordered the large format fried chicken for 4-8 people and this reservation was done online.  I made this reservation 5 weeks in advance for a Friday and the time slots were only 6pm or 9pm.  If I wanted a 7pm slot I would have had to make it a Wednesday or some other day.  I can only assume it's because a reservation for 4 requires a table, not a bar and not a short counter along the wall considering it's a family style meal for sharing.  The reservation required me to make the booking with my credit card and was notified if we cancelled too late or no showed it would be automatically charged.  The large format fried chicken dinner for 4-8 people is 125 dollars.  

Visually the Noodle Bar is not spacious and community seating is normal here.  We didn't have our own table and it seemed tight.  There is a coat rack near the front and the stool type seating prevents you from using your chair to hold your coat.  There's not much room and the platter of fried chicken will take up most of your space but it's still doable

Now, I've had my share of fried chicken all over the continent in a variety of different places and as of late I think I'm getting a good taste of Asian fried chicken particularly of the Korean variety and I'd have to say that Momofuku's version of fried chicken is pretty Momofuku'ing AMAZING.

We started off with the pork buns which I consider a death row last meal kind of snack.  These little tiny buns are filled with melt in your mouth pork balanced in such a way you feel like you are eating something from heaven wrapped in a cloud.

The fried chicken comes with a whole lot of things on the side to suit taste but the mains are baby bib lettuce and scallion pancakes to act as a wrap.  The chicken is served in 2 ways; American style which is dry on the outside (no sauce) and the Korean style CRISPY coating and skin sauced with a sweet and spicy sauce.  The sauce, batter and skin of the KFC version is divine.  It is as much as I remember the type of skin on Turntable's KFC in NYC to be very CRISPY but with more sauce and much more crunch to the point that the coating is almost ""candied"".  The skin is so crispy and becomes an extra layer of coating that you must bite through and with the candied type sweet and hot it creates a whole different flavor and texture experience.  

The scallion pancakes are a perfect density which are strong enough to hold and have a wonderful texture and consistency to be able to provide a healthy bite through when stuffed.  When adding a bib leaf and some of the sides to flavor the end result is a completely wonderful mix of taste and textures that balance so beautifully to the point of being seduced into not caring how much this meal will cost.  

This fried chicken meal made me forget a bit what it was like to have that KFC at Turntable on 5th Avenue on June 12th, 2015.  That is NOT a small feat.  

Sparkling water was ""Q"" water in a decanter and they charged 2.50 a person.  The pork buns are 5 bucks and we each had one.  The Milk Bar that is available at this location is essentially a self serve glass room refrigerator where you can help yourself to any goodies you'd like and have them charged to your table.  My wife picked up a cookie and a Crack Pie to take home.  

For dessert they also have a version of soft serve ice cream in 2 flavors but I only ordered one which was the ""cereal milk"" flavor.  Imagine this if you will, when you have a bowl of cereal and you are left with the milk what does it taste like?  That's what this ice cream tastes like.  You can add corn flake crisps to this cup of ice cream which is stuck on the side but some will fall off.  Their soft serve is more solidified than say Dairy Queen and more of a gelato density.

All in all this is the best meal I've had in Toronto in a long time.",21,12,16,positive

Server was quite rude and snobby, & greeting staff at the door seemed almost annoyed that my small party showed up at the door in the first place.  The waitstaff was so curt that I almost didn't leave a tip...though I ended tipping anyway (although the bill was accepted without even the usual courtesy 'thank you', by the way). Take-out isn't much help either, as they do not take phone orders (as they said they can't process credit cards over the phone) which means you must physically be there to place your order, then wait for it at the door.

Let's look at the food, service aside:  The food is edible, but highly forgettable. Pretty fresh ingredients. Very so-so taste for a higher than so-so price.  Great egg though, contributing to 1 star out of 2 (the other one goes towards the pretty, albeit rather useless design that I'm sure you've read online reviews about). Broth lacks depth and overall flavour. It's much more like a cheap, boxed, grocery-store ""consomme""  than broth.  Most of the flavour at Momofuku Noodle Bar comes from heavy doses of sriracha (or ssam) ...which, um, you can pick up from any Asian grocery store for $5.  Presentation is nice, lots of dashes of colour.  Seems to be a major theme of ""looks pretty, feels empty"" going on here.

Considered writing a more scathing review, referring to the bland diet in preparation of a certain colon cleanse necessary for medical procedure, but decided to hold back as to not be so mean - after all, at least the inside of this place is clean right?

I didn't know what to expect - I just knew I had been dying to check it out and tonight was the night. I typically hit up restaurants alone (we can talk about how depressing that is later) but a good restaurant never makes me feel weird about that. Noodle Bar was a brilliant example. They sat me on the bar in front of the open kitchen, and they were friendly, attentive and fun. I ordered the pork buns and the cold spicy noodles. The food comes out fast, hot, and (since I watched it being made) fresh. I have a weird relationship with pork belly, usually finding the layer of fat to be too overwhelming. The pork on the pork bun was so evenly balanced that the fat just melted into the tender meat. A touch of sirracha on the side adds the perfect heat to the sweetness of the steamed bun. And I can't say enough about the damned bun. Damn that bun. That was a damned good bun. 

My noodles were chewy and the right temperature (cold!) but the real winner in that dish are the cashews. Sweet and roasted, they balance the seschwan spiciness and add a desirable crunch.

Noodles have a overcooked texture, probably got the ratios wrong, definitely not hand pulled\/cut\/made to obtain the elasticity of the dough.

Honestly, this is a great place if you eat bland food like grilled chicken and steamed veg everyday

this spot is good for people who never had real asian flavours, you get better, cheaper buns from banh mi boyz, you get better noodle soup at ANY ramen shop around town, and that's saying a lot (Aijisen anyone?).

We thought, hmm let's wait 30 minutes and see if the line situation changes.

The hostess took my name and phone number on their iPad and advised she'd text me when our spots were ready.  I say spots because this is another communal seating arrangements, meaning you won't get any privacy, the seats are stools so you won't get those nice comfy chairs that you can lean your backs on like a normal restaurant. 

We waited about an hour upstairs on the second floor in the lounge area (so much for 2 hours and 30 minutes), we sat in the nice leather seats overlooking the main dining area below on the main floor.  What can I say, we enjoy people watching.  We noticed that the turnaround rate was quite fast, people weren't staying around to chit chat for some reason.  

We were sat down at a table meant for 4 people; we were the only ones there.  My gf excused herself to go the bathroom, leaving her bag on her seat.  A large group of 10 people or so were then seated immediately behind me at a table meant for 6.  Needless to say, one of the male members of that group noticed there were 3 empty seats at my adjacent table for 4.  He was like, ""are these seats taken, I'd like to use them if possible, you're here alone it looks like so it should be ok.""  I was taken quite aback at his rude assumption I was by myself. 1st, don't jump to conclusions, 2nd, my gf's bag was in the seat across from mine, 3rd, how dare you assume I'm by myself. I said to him in a stern voice, ""Buddy, do I look like I'm the type that would come to a place like this alone on a Friday night? Look at what I'm wearing, look at my gf's belongings in the seat! I don't care about these 2 empty seats but you will and cannot take the seat that my girlfriend is sitting in!""  With that, he promptly turned around as one of the waitresses came over.  What a d-bag I thought...

Anyway, sorry for the side bar and onto the menu.  It was simple, 12 items in total. Gf ordered from the mains, the ramen with pork belly. I ordered the kimchi stew.  We also ordered the pork buns at $10 per order, comes with two($5 per bun)! 

The ramen was quick to arrive within 5 minutes of ordering. The stew came about 10 minutes later and the two pork buns came about 10 minutes from the moment my stew came.

Gf thought the ramen noodles were rubbery\/chewy, the stew was flavorful but not the kind you want. It was salty, she could taste the MSG in it. It had a slight aftertaste. The pork belly had no flavor if not for the soup base.  Also, the bowl for her ramen was large but it was only filled halfway, aka small portions. She notes they used pickled cabbage in the broth and plenty of it. (Sounds like kimchi?) My kimchi stew arrived with a side of rice in a bowl.  First glance the stew looked spicy with a heavy orange color.  Upon tasting the stew however, it was all an illusion. It was not spicy at all, rather had a sour aftertaste. Similar to tom yum instant noodle soup but with more emphasis on sourness. It was, very, very, very tame.  Even with the bottle of hot sauce on the side that was at every table, this kimchi stew was disappointing.  Gf detected a hint of spice used in the aftertaste though, as she's sensitive to it and doesn't eat any spicy food at all. There were plenty of vegetables and pork in it, the same ones they are using in the ramen, the pork buns.  And onto the even more disappointing pork buns.  You can't really call it a bun when it's just a sticky dough roll cut in the middle, stuffed with 3 pieces of pork belly, some thinly sliced cucumber, add the same sauce flavor found in the ramen. At $10 per order, I expected more. It was such a letdown. It should been priced at $4.50 per order of two if anything.  This is suppose to be the signature dish?? Really??  Why don't Momofuku just leave the salty sauce alone, give me a salt shaker and I'll do it myself?


I did not finish my stew as I found the more I ate it, the saltier it got which made me drink more water. Even now close to 4 hours later I find myself thirsty because of this super salty stew.  Gf was drinking a lot of water on the way home as well as she could still smell and taste the ramen broth as it was also salty. 

The damage came to $46 something, I tipped 15%. The service was impeccable and friendly though, especially in the lounge area upstairs which has its own cash.  IF you order a drink upstairs, be sure to cash out before heading down to dine. 

For $50 something dollars, we left disappointed and unsatisfied. Especially after all the hype surrounding this place.  We expected more.

We tried the chicken ramen (soup) and the chilled spicy noodles. Both were very good! 

The broth of the ramen soup was rich and a little sweet from the miso. It had a lot of nicely roasted chicken in it, a lot more meat than I was expecting! And so many noodles.

The cold noodles were not overly spicy, and so delicious. There was a lot of black bean in mine so it was a little too salty, but it paired well with the sweetness of the candied cashews.

Chang and Momofuku Noodle have almost done themselves a disservice by bringing back the ramen revolution a decade ago as the Noodle Bar classic ramen has in some ways overshadowed the other far more interesting food (including other types of ramen) that is getting churned out at this casual eatery.

So let's talk about the 800 pound gorilla\/elephant\/insert-your-other-favourite-large- mammal-here in the room: yes you can probably get more authentic and possibly better classic ramen for a few bucks less at other places in Toronto; no that shouldn't stop you from coming here as Chang is known for his innovation and ideas, not for his authenticity (and frankly, while I get the idea of ordering what a place is ""known for"", I don't understand how anyone could see this interesting menu and decide not to stray from straight ahead ramen as ""famous"" as it may be). 

Do yourself a favour. Go here and ask to sit at the bar. Watch the precision and technical skill that goes into making every dish. Look at how calm everyone is as they go about their job. This kitchen is a well oiled machine.

Order anything but the classic ramen and I promise that you won't be disappointed. I've had (and loved) the tongue pastrami ramen (personal favourite), the smoked chicken ramen, the cold chili noodles, the hanger steak, the ginger noodles, the pork bun, the kimchi, a delicious lake fish (can't remember what kind as it was a while ago) and the rice cakes. Each of these was very, very good and some of them were flawless.  

Furthermore, a lot of these dishes are poor man's versions of the ones you'll see at Daisho for significantly more money (with the primary difference between the two restaurants in my opinion being that Noodle Bar uses less fancy\/expensive ingredients). 

Now, if you get a ramen\/noodle dish and a beer it'll set you back about $27-$30 all- in. If you add a bun, it'll be closer to $35. If you get one of the standalone proteins it may even push $40. 

Regardless, I challenge you to eat a more interesting, well-cooked meal for that price anywhere downtown or even in the rest of the city for that matter. Furthermore, I hear they have a prix fixe now that comes for $18 and which includes a bun, a ramen and a Milk bar cookie. 

Come on folks, the eating downtown may be slowly improving (thank you Richmond Station, Buca, Ja Bistro and the Gabardine) but it is still very slim pickings out there; this is my automatic go-to for dinner downtown.

Momofuku Noodle Bar has a really great trendy, sleek vibe. I love the inconspicuous and subtle door you walk through to get to all the ""action.""

The seating is mostly communal style and bar seating. Our party of 6 tried calling for reservations around 6pm but were told that they were completely booked until 10pm. We popped by anyway (wanted to check out the Milk Bar) and at 6:30 the Noodle Bar wasn't even half full. Weird. Anyway, they let us grab a table.

While I didn't go for the ramen, I tried the following:

Blueberry, Orange, Lemonade Vodka Slushie - This was very tart, but quite refreshing & yummy, though I will say it melted from being a true Slushie before I could finish it (and I only got the 4 oz)
Black Garlic Ranch Smoked Corn - yum! The flavour on these babies are really good. It's served on the corn and sliced up into 4 pieces, so really great for sharing and only $4.
Japanese Smoked Corn - a spicy, seaweed, fishy-ish type taste on this corn. I felt the flavours worked kind of weird together. We didn't finish this one. I'd stick with the Black Garlic Ranch.
Smoked Chicken Wings - maybe I got my hopes up too high for this one, as I did read quite a few good things about these wings, but I was thoroughly not impressed. The seasoning wasn't bad, but I felt not powerful enough as the wings (especially the drumsticks) felt very one-note and sort of bland once you got through that inital bite. I felt like it needed something stronger to give it a kick or something to really make these wings stand out.

I'd give Momofuku Noodle Bar a second chance to try out the ramen and perhaps one of the buns, but I don't see myself running back here anytime soon!",2,0,1,positive

Being a Anthony Bourdain fan, and Korean, I was fully aware of the reputation of the Chef and the Momofuku brand.  However, having read the reviews here, I went in with moderate expectations.  I started out with the peach beer and it was light and refreshing.  Then moved on to the famous pork buns.  They as great as advertised. Simple in presentation, but well executed. the pork dissolves in you mouth.  We also ordered some ramen and although I thought it was a very nice version of ramen, it was still just a bowl of noodles.  To end the meal, I splurged and got the fired chicken with caviar.  I found the chicken was crispy, juicy, sweet and delicious.  However, barely tasted the caviar and it is not worth $80.  Overall, it was not as bad as people say, and I will be going back for the pork buns and beer ONLY.

Went to summerlicious and the cured salmon was bland and not appetizing at all. Reminds me of a downgraded poke bowl in San Fran. My Dan Dan noodles was probably the best dish all meal, but that's not saying much. It was mildly warm, egg was slightly raw which I liked, ramen noodles were slightly al dente, broth was thick and flavourful. At least it tasted like a completed dish. The cold noodles was too much. Warm noodles cooked in a Chinese taste, mixed with Korean kimchi, and a splash of Japanese cold side dishes all in one bowl. Fusion is one thing and I love fusion. But clash of different cultures to the point where it felt like a messy art piece compared to an intricately designed dish is not my cup of tea. 

The bao was too hard and not quite fully steamed through to bring out the fluffiness of the bread, meat within was too dry and sauce was evident but not flavourful. 

Desert was horrific. Ice cream was creamy and milky and acceptable. The cheesecake? My god I literally started crying mid-bite because i was choking on it. Couldn't get past two spoonfuls. And I'm a girl. All girls would not leave dessert unattended...but I had to let that ship sail. Cheesecake was well whipped, but overpowering taste of cream made it feel like I was slurping down thickened whipped butter. I can't even write about it without feeling nauseous so I'll stop. 

Long story short... Disappointed and never again am I stepping foot in this restaurant. Oh mind you, service was horrible. The entire duration never saw one smile from the server. It was like I owed her a million dollars. Brutal experience is all I can say. Truly brutal.",0,2,1,negative

But my friend Danny was like OH YOU HAVE TO GO, I WILL TAKE YOU, and having heard so much about the mystique of ~David Chang~ (he was fun when he was a guest on Top Chef!!), I figured it was finally time to wander into the Financial district and over pay for a bowl of noddles!

We walked in around 6.30 pm, and the two of us were given a seat right at the entrance of the restaurant on the long bar table. We would have literally been sitting right in front of the door. The moment I saw the grimace on Danny's face I knew we had to move, so right after they put the menu's down, we were just like ""um hi, can we sit somewhere else pretty please."" The hostess paused, looked over the restaurant, took way to long to figure out that, yes, she could sit us somewhere else, it was just that she'd have to break up an empty space of 6, but eventually we were moved and sat on the edge of one of their communal tables.

I got the signature Momofuku Ramen Bowl and it was...okay I guess? The pork was cooked really well, but generally flavourless. I enjoyed the mix of fermented cabbage, seaweed and poached egg. The broth was rather salty, but I still had a fun time putting in a bunch of siracha on ma noodles.

The star of the show that night for me though was the BBQ chicken buns. One of my chicken pieces was half gristle which was a bummer, but I managed to eat around it and enjoy myself immensely.

Seriously, I could eat 12 of those bbq chicken buns. The red eye mayo is like...a miracle.

The bill was steep for a bowl of soup and 2 chicken buns (30 bucks including tip) And I feel that a lot of that bill is mainly for the celebrity chef dining experience...and also for the real estate you're eating it in.

I've been to the noodle bar twice. I had the ramen both times - the broth was heavy and very flavourful. During the first visit I had an entire bowl to myself, which I thought was too much. The second time I shared with others and I enjoyed it a lot more. The pork buns were delicious, as many other people have written. I also really loved the onigiri (rice balls) but unfortunately, they're no longer on the menu.

The milk bar upstairs is also worth a visit, although I've only tried two things, both that I enjoyed. First, the famous crack pie. It tastes mostly like a sugar pie (ie. it's very sweet and tastes of butter and brown sugar) so sharing it with others is ideal. The second item was the soft serve ice cream that can be ordered just at the cash. There are two flavours: cereal milk, which has a bit of a tang, and coffee. I suggest getting a mix of the two and asking for the corn flake crumb. It's a small portion for a hefty price (about $7) but as a one time treat it was a delight. I finished it in a matter of minutes.

I had been meaning to stop by the Milk Bar one of these days to try some of the cereal milk ice cream, and today's 30+degree weather prompted me to go for it. I headed over after work to grab some, and was looking forward to unwinding in the air conditioning with my treat for a few minutes after a long day.

I sat down at one of the tables by the window, just long enough to snap a pic of my ice cream and take two bites. After that a gentleman who works at the restaurant came over to inform me that they were closing the dining room between 4 and 5. The guy then stands there hovering over me as if to imply I should pack up my things to get out of there right away. I looked at my phone and it was 3:59. I was then essentially urged out the door onto the street. 

This was appalling customer service. I'm just wondering why this man couldn't have given me five minutes to eat my two ounce cup of ice cream I just paid for? Have you been trained to rush customers out of your restaurant so that your schedule can be accommodated, buddy? As someone with restaurant experience I usually let a lot slide when it comes to mistakes and mix ups, but this was appalling and ruined my experience. Your sense of entitlement is not okay, and I feel ashamed that tourists might be coming to your restaurant and experiencing this kind of treatment.

I think if you're charging these prices in Toronto? U have to really be able to deliver or it'll leave a bad taste in people's mouths. 

We came on the second day of opening. A short wait outside early on in the evening, 530 ish? The door man was super nice. The seating is a bit cramped. The menu is super small, I suppose that's what the noodle bar consists of? We both ordered a ramen dish, one cold, one hot in soup. The cold one is REALLY spicy. The hot one was super super mediocre. They are not bad?? But definitely not worth the $16 ish price tags, I think the ramen at Kenzo on Dundas is 10x better and way cheaper. 

What urked me the most was ... the wine. If you're going to serve wine at a food establishment ? Please do it properly. They gave me red wine in .., A SHOOTER GLASS. it was ridiculous. I'm not a wine snob?? But I know u do not drink wine out of a shooter glass. I've done it at home when I'm ghetto and broke all wine glasses??

I wish I got a picture of it. Inside, I really liked the decor! It's really upscale looking, and the atmosphere is nice. We were seated at the ""bar"" overlooking the kitchen. I didn't mind sharing a long table with random people as there was sufficient spacing between us. I liked watching the staff prepare food. I thought the seats were a little uncomfortable though. Service is average but they were very attentive with the water throughout the meal. The hostess was not the friendliest, unfortunately. 

We ordered the tongue bun and a Momofuku ramen each. The tongue bun took awhile to get there, and we weren't even finished eating it when our ramens came. That was some poor timing.

The tongue buns were good. The tongue was more like a soft roast beef sliced thinly. The buns were nice and hot. 

The Momofuku ramen was pretty okay. It's not amazing and not bad. The broth was okay, nothing special, just a clear broth. The noodles were average. The egg was cooked so the inside was runny, which I like. I saw in the kitchen that they had prepared like 50 of them beforehand. There were 2 slices of fatty pork belly. I would have preferred not fatty pork. I've been to ramen places where you can choose the fattiness. And, they were small slices. There was also green onion and seaweed on the side of the bowl. The vegetables were some sort of leafy cabbage that was a little sour, as if it was pickled? Kind of weird for a ramen. Lastly there was some shredded meat in the corner, and a bit of sauce in the middle. I would say that I liked the variety of stuff they had in the bowl, but nothing was outstanding. At $15, this was definitely overpriced.

From reading the reviews, I agree that it's a bit over hyped. I would not go here if I felt like having some good authentic ramen. I would come again though if I wanted to impress someone with a fancy looking trendy place and okay\/decent food. The price is kind of steep, though. I still had a great time although I was not full!

Location
Heart of downtown core, at the lobby of Shangri-La hotel.  Spacious interior design, sky high ceilings, modern accoutrements. There are 3 levels: first is for the noodle bar and appetizers, 2nd is for the milk\/dessert bar, and 3rd is a more formal experience. 

Service
Friendly albeit slightly aloof servers. Prompt kitchen service. 

Food
We only went to the noodle bar and milk bar and had:

++ smoked chicken ramen (love the crunchy chicken)
++ momofuku ramen (a bit of a kick, but quite tasty)
++ pork buns (2 open baos, with a big pork slice -- yum)
+ chicken meatball buns (love the tangy ssam sauce)
+ okonomiyaki (not bad, but also not stellar)
++ assorted cookies from the milk bar (my fave: cornflake choco chip marshmallow)

Ramen items ranged from $13-$16.  Appetizers from $6-$11. And if you're feeling spendy, the $175 caviar and fried chicken.

They used to have an EPIC BBQ chicken ramen bowl that my partner and I would get every time bc it was like I said, EPIC. Sadly I guess cost has got the best of them and they got rid of that option with their new 2016 menu. And now nothing similar to that even exists. Their chicken option is ground chicken, they have cut back on portion size and you don't get nearly as much broth. It's really disappointing.

I had a love affair with David Chang. In my head.  He's a Korean-American chef who, as portrayed on television and the media, appears hilarious. I'm a sucker for laughs. His life revolves around pork. I'm a sucker for pigs. He's won three James Beard awards. I'm a sucker for over-achievers.

Now I say HAD for two reasons: Obviously I'm a grown woman and don't really have fantasy relationships with chefs I love. Secondly, I liked his mission - to bring quality food to middle-class public - but I'm not sure that's happening in Toronto. 

I always thought he was largely responsible for bringing the no-frills\/my-way-or-the highway attitude back to the city of NYC. In fact, his many restaurants are a testament to the fact the public doesn't mind his attitude, if he's serving good grub. Then he opened Momofuku Noodle Bar at the Shangri-La? Really? It's so not middle-class. But I suppose given the fact the restaurant's menu is still reasonably priced, I shouldn't judge where, and only the what. So I will, but I am no longer crushing.  

We decided to grab a drink while waiting, and as we were finishing up (an hour or so later), I got a text from Momofuku telling us out table was ready and it would be held for ten minutes.  No one likes to wait.  But knowing that you can leave your number and get a text is efficient.  You can use that time to wait aimlessly, or you can use that time.  Your choice, not Chang's.

We got seated - and it's cute.  The little wooden stools were fine for me and Aerie, but we're petite, I wonder how comfortable they are for anyone bigger.  Service was friendly, fun, and SO efficient.

Full disclosure dictates that I tell you I love Chang's pork buns. So yes, they are just as loveable here north of the border. Everything else? Well, it's good. Aerie and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal (but could have done without the sake slush cocktail...).  

I've heard all the complaints, and there are many momofukuhaters: ""for a $16 bowl of noodles, it was sh*t"", ""I hated it"", ""it's alright, nothing to wait in line for"", the rice was okay""...

I have nothing to say to those people. We are all entitled to our own opinions. I mean I just threw down a big one about the fact it's in a haughty hotel. But at the end of the day, I always eat in CONTEXT. Chang's signature dish is perfect.  If you don't know. Get.to.know.  His lobster buns were also stellar - fresh, flavourful and a nice change from the pork.
 
The ramen was neithre heavy nor rich, but flavourful. And the egg - PERFECTLY cooked - it ooooozedddd.  I will say this - it is better than that KENZO-crap everyone thinks is good.  (Sorry, that was overtly aggressive).

Chang's food is good and it's moderately priced. That's exactly what he wanted to do. In context, it all makes sense so I'm not going to knit-pick. And trust me, if there was no context I would.  During my last visit to NYC I was sorely disappoitned with some of the food at momofuku.  I was annoyed, but far from hating.  His pork buns never let me down. They are like my family.

There are so many great ramen places in Toronto--there's no reason to go here and pay ridiculous prices for average food (unless you're the sad sort of individual who swoons over the recognized name and the shi-shi hip decor...). I went because a friend made the plans, but I won't make the same mistake again.

So the pork buns were $10, which was annoying in itself. Then they came--two of them--and they were small white buns stuffed entirely with blubber. Ok, I get it, some people like to bite into a chunk of solid pig fat. But I am not those people and I had to pick almost everything out of my bun so I wouldn't gag and possibly barf all over the table.

Go upstairs to Daisho and pay a little bit more for a better experience. Basically, go anywhere else for anything else for better quality and value. Also, no place for your coats! #DesignFail.

Um, a bowl of ramen + an order of pork buns + a beer will cost your $35 before tax and tip. WTF?! Is this stuff made from unicorn sweat?!  Price alone drops this rating to 1-star - there's just too much competition around to justify anything higher.

For what amounts to Japanese fast food, people can't seem to pay enough. If McCafes charged this amount for their combos, people would revolt! At least McCafes are more spacious, allows you to hang your coat and brews a solid cup of joes.

To their credit, the PORK BUNS has been faithfully translated from their Saam Bar. They, unfortunately, also translated the same pricing policy to their SHITAKE BUNS, which were a bit too salty. The MOMOFUKU ""RAMEN"", however, tasted more like buckwheat noodles and the choice of adding kimchi creates a jarring sour taste to the salty (and forgettable) broth. The pork was nicely portioned and the egg was done alright. Service was pretty good. I've heard their chilled ramen is the highlight, but honestly, it's gonna be a while before I'm back.

Today we were celebrating my husband's birthday and he really wanted to try Momofuku Noodle Bar. It has been one of the worst dining experiences we have had in a while. The host was flustered with Milk orders and no server came to help her so we waited at least 15 minutes to be seated. 

The menu is simple. We ordered the recommendations made by the server. Her name was Roxy and she was very rude. I understand your kitchen will close at 3pm but it is very unnecessary to convey the message with the amount of rudeness that you did. We ordered the Pork Buns, Momofuku Ramen, Tsukemen and two Milk Ice-creams. The server came to check on us prior to us eating the food completely. I really did not like my Tsukemen as it tasted so sour to the point it tasted like it has gone bad. The flavour combination just did not work for me. I ate one mouthful of the noodle. I sent it back. Not only did Roxy not take it off the bill, she charged us extra cereal for our milk soft serve that WE DID NOT order. Thank you so much! She disappeared after dropping the bill. We tried to flag the other servers to get her. I had to walk up to the host to ask for an adjustment on my bill and she came and said the kitchen wont let me take it off the bill because I ate it. I ate one bite seriously!!! She grunted and said she will talk to the kitchen. She came with an adjusted bill with so much attitude. No apology no nothing. This is no way to treat a customer. We left the money on the table and left. 

I also work in the industry and really this is so unacceptable. Especially when you work for such a great chef with such a good reputation. Is this the customer service you want to give first time diners Momofuku Noodle Bar?

I've been avoiding the noodle bar ever since it opened because of the terrible reviews I've heard from friends. Tonight, I decided to just go and try it myself because I was having a particular craving for the cereal milk soft serve (which they didn't end up having anyway), and unfortunately, my friends were right. Considering the price I paid ($65 for 2 sets of buns and 2 ramen bowls), it could possibly be the worst ramen I've ever had.

I think the main problem with their dishes is that the meats are not marinated or marinated long enough. The pork belly just tastes like a steamed pork belly with no seasoning. There isn't much flavour in the broth either, and so every dish tasted bland. I ordered the Momofuku ramen, and my friend ordered the chicken miso ramen and they were both equally bland. The buns weren't much better either - very underwhelming compared to the buns from Ippudo.

I wanted to wait at least a month before trying momofuku Noodle Bar Toronto, the new offspring of David Chang's momofuku empire. Not because it's polite to wait to review a restaurant (it may be but why open if you aren't ready?), I just didn't want to be stuck waiting in line for seemingly ever. But when you live with a chef, you take any opportunity to try something new and well reared, together (they work a lot).

So we woke up this morning and decided today was the day. noodle bar (to) opened this week to an instant line up, above and underground hype. 

The minute you open the beautifully carved out door, you know this is something, somewhere different. From the greeter (who takes your name and cell number) to the hostess who seats you, service is taken as serious as Grandmas's game of scrabble here....""

From the modern style decor, the stylized disposable chopsticks, wooden benches with a convenient coat hook, Momofuku Noodle Bar (MNB) aims to please. Unfortunately for the foodie, this MNB falls short in the worst possible way: The food. 

Going into MNB is an exercise in economic self-evaluation. You can sit in the noodle bar, which is on the first floor, have fancy drinks up on the second floor, or really live it up with culinary gastro-experiences in the Daisho on the third floor. While maybe not intentioned, the literal tower of wealth as you went up the restaurant didn't impress me and gave me the feeling that my dollars were spent on lower quality food or that we weren't as valued.  

Me and my dining partner ordered 2 momofuku ramens, which included pork belly, a softboiled egg, noodles, and a tonkotsu (I think) broth, garnished with seaweed and some kind of slightly spicy shrimp paste. We also ordered a set of pork buns to share.

The pork buns seemed to be a big hit around the restaurant, with just about every group ordering them. However, compared to other pork buns we have tried (Ippudo comes to mind), these fell short. The seasoning was plain, and the pork was unimpressive. For 16 dollars, you could do a lot better.

The ramen came shortly after, and was disappointingly presented. The noodles appeared to be haphazardly thrown in, with a few pieces of grey pork belly slices and some dried seaweed. The dollop of spicy paste was probably the most interesting, but I still had to use some of the sriracha sauce they put on the table for the pork buns in the broth. When I had to add sriracha, it reminded me of eating instant ramen which turned me off in a way. I don't want to have to add extra sauces that weren't intentionally used for the food, and the fact that I had to supplement this uninteresting bowl of noodles with 3 dollar rooster sauce was disappointing. 

The noodles were reasonable, chewy and tasty. However the broth and pork slices were both bland and unappealing, given the price we paid. After having paid nearly $60 for two ramens and some pork buns, we left MNB empty and disappointed. It's a great place for groups, the decor is nice, and the service was friendly and fast. But the most important part about going for food is actually how the food tastes, and it is in this regard that Momofuku Noodle Bar fails. There are better places in DT Toronto to spending your money.",1,0,0,positive

We went here for the Summerlicious and I beg you don't follow. 
The Service was some of the worst that I have come across in a long time, and I know everyone is going to think that it is Summerlicious so of course the service wasn't that great, but as someone who spent many years of my life in the restaurant service industry, I assure you the issues that I have with the service at this restaurant are not caused by this but rather a sign of what is happening in restaurant service these days, the service is disappearing. 
Simple things that used to be taught to you the first day you shadowed a server at your first job like never head back to the kitchen without something I your hand, check to see if everything is ok with the meal, that they wouldn't like another beer, glass of wine, or something more to eat to fill the void that remains after the small child size meal you gave them.
Ok so since I have a good rant going here it goes I never thought I would reach this point in my life but here it comes...
I miss the day's when server's wore cloths that made them look like they should be handling food.
I know, I guess I am getting old but I have to admit it is the truth I do.
Now to be fair it's not so much that the food wasn't good, it really wasn't that bad, completely over priced, that is a  better description.
Look I don't expect or actually want extremely large portions, but for $25 plus tax the meal consisted of a small jar of preserves to begin, for the main course 2 drum sticks,  that's it, no side, just 2 pieces of Boston lettuce under the chicken, but that was it, and then the dessert, lol... it was a single truffle, about the size of a now it was a good truffle but believe me you are bot going to feel like you have had more then an appetizer by the time you leave.

 The menu has more than doubled in size since the opening weeks, and there are now desserts on offer.

I've been a few times since they opened, and the consistency has been pretty good, although on one visit the ramen broth had slightly too much tare, leaving it slightly salty.

Highlights are the hanger steak with soy hollandaise and confit crispy potatoes, the always amazing pork buns and the signature ramen. A special one night of seared veal sweetbreads in a fish sauce caramel with toasted coconut and cilantro was flawless, I hope it makes it onto the menu soon.

That being said, pretty much everything I've tried here has been solidly delicious. I also don't see how anyone can complain about the prices, if you can get stuffed full and have a beer for under $30 before tip, then I think it's pretty good value in this day and age, especially considering you're getting locally sourced, high quality produce.

What did I enjoy the most.  Beer selection.  And the pickles were yummy.   But for all my bemoaning, I did go back for another visit, so what does that say about me.

1) I have to admit, the simplicity of it all is kinda cool. The set up of the downstairs restaurant was nice. Wood everything and the disposable chopsticks were looking pretty nifty!

2) Shiitake buns - I loved the taco shell like presentation with the buns. The crunchy sliced cucumber was an amazing touch but I felt that the hoisin sauce was too overpowering. A little less salt goes a long way in really bringing out the quality of the ingredients used. The mushrooms were perfect. And scallion? What scallion?

3) Smoked chicken ramen - I dug the bamboo shoots, but I am just a sucker for them ""menma"" (I learnt a new word). I really liked how crispy the pieces of chicken were. They weren't very flavourful to be honest but I liked the overall texture it added. The poached egg - I'm ordering it without next time... 

4) Momofuku ramen - You must like pork belly. It's a little fatty, I just skimmed it off. Very tender meat. The fish cakes, no. They are not fish cakes. Slices yes. and they added nothing except a fancy swirl. I found that the taste of the soup was more authentic in this dish. The piece of crisp seaweed was a nice touch.

Also, side note, spiracha hot sauce... really? You aren't a pho place! Ramen needs some more authentic spices... You are in the Shangri-La hotel, I expect you to grow your own hot peppers!

This restaurant really deserves a 3. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I had a good time and my luncheon date was hot. haha. And based on everyone else's comments, I need to go back and try me some of them pork buns.",1,2,0,positive

Our server, Mary was fantastic! She was fast, accurate and attentive to all 17 of us. With that many people we were able to order a variety of noodles, rice bowls and buns.  Good things were the pork belly bun and chilli chicken bun.  The rice bowl was nothing to rave about.  Same goes with the noodles. We had the pepper noodle, extremely spicy noodle, tan tan noodle, pork ramen, chicken ramen and the potato ramen.  For me, the pork ramen was the best out of the bunch because of the broth.  Not good enough for me the become a fan of ramen.
Too salty for my taste and the noodles were gummy. The spicy noodle was not that spicy.  It had a very slight kick but no other flavour. We tried the two different types of kimchi they offered.  Both were just sour and did not have the depth of flavour you get with traditional kimchi.  Definitely can get better kimchi from the grocery store.

We checked out the noodle bar on the ground floor as well as the milk bar on the second floor. We did pop up to the third floor to check out what it looked like.I did a bit of research before coming and saw that the pork buns and momofuku ramen were a popular choice. And of course, we had to try the cereal milk and crack pie soft serve.

The breakdown: 

Pork buns: really well seasoned, well cooked, delicious, BUT pretty fatty. Truthfully though, I am more than okay with a bit of extra fat because it was absolutely delightful. The burst of flavours really shook up my taste buds. Highly recommend. 

Momofuku ramen: Really well presented, flavours were on point for the first few bites and as a whole, the dish came through nicely. But once you start dissecting each piece of the dish, you'll find that the pork is a under-seasoned (nothing special about it, just tastes like meat), the egg was a little too raw for my liking, and the broth gets pretty salty. The reason why the dish comes together nicely is because the broth balances out the flavour of - or rather lack thereof - the pork. Overall, you could probably find a better bowl of ramen at a cheaper price elsewhere. 

Soft serve: You have to get it with the corn flakes. Get the full experience. The cereal milk flavoured soft serve reminded me a lot of the Horlicks drink I grew up on. It was... very interesting to say the least. I preferred the crack pie flavour. Feel like the soft serve here was a little overrated. Overall, tasted good, but my life has not changed. 

Milk bar upstairs: I bought the birthday truffles, a chocolate chocolate cookie and a blueberry and cream. Disclaimer: I have a crazy sweet tooth. Out of the three items I bought, I highly recommend the chocolate chocolate cookie. It's very soft and really hits the spot, but not in the way where you feel like your heart might explode from sweetness overload (although you should probably enjoy it with a glass of milk or something to tone down the sweetness if you find it too sweet). 

The atmosphere here was very interesting. Going from the first to the third was an experience in itself. I felt like I was going from a somewhat average area to a more upscale spot. Let me explain: the first floor almost looks like a picnic\/caf area. The second floor has the milk bar and from what I remember, a small seating area (I could be wrong, I was too excited to go into the little milk bar shop area). The third floor looked really nice and classy, a nice place to go for a glass of wine maybe. 

Service was great. Our server, Michael, checked in on us every so often to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He didn't overwhelm us with his presence though and we never felt rushed. 

I'd definitely come back for the pork buns and the milk bar. Jury is still out for whether or not I'd have another bowl of ramen + soft serve though.

I have had real ramen in Japan and some really good ramen in Seattle. I do respect that this is Momofuku's take on the dishes and neither should be identical to what I would expect. 

The Smoked Chicken Ramen: 
Taste:
For what it is, it is okay. The flavors were not balanced and instead the broth was greasy and salty. It certainly didn't inspire me to slurp all the broth, as I normally do with good ramen. Bits of the ramen were very good: the mushrooms, the bamboo shoots, the real chunks of chicken, and the chicken skin. The noodles themselves were excellent. Overall balance though in the broth just wasn't there. There was an egg, as should be in ramen. Yet it was too soft and just disappeared into the ramen, not in a good way, it just disappeared. 

Presentation:  
You get a ramen sized bowl and then look deep inside to find your ramen, several inches below the rim. The steam does not rise out of the bowl, instead it was luke warm broth over hot noodles. I can understand a cold\/hot play on the food and that works in Japan with Tsukemen, but not here. I may have just gotten a dish with not adequately heated broth. Presentation wise the dish size should match the portion size, here it just doesn't. Also, they provide small spoons, too small to be used adequately. Maybe customers aren't supposed to consume the broth here? If the spoon was bigger and had an angle over the handle end, it could hang over the edge of the bowl while you slurp your noodles. Instead it just gets lost in the bottom of the broth. I'm not saying the portion size was too small, just the bowl and presentation balance doesn't work for me. 

If I went again, I would order a different dish of noodles. Maybe the ones w\/o broth are better. 

The Okinomiyaki: 
Taste:
Good. It had more flour and less cabbage than the traditional Japanese version. It was really more like a savory american pancake. Here I appreciated a different take on the dish. Because, it worked. Balanced flavors, dancing fish flakes, visually with a little difference, textured a little differently, and taste a little different. 

Presentation:
Beautiful. Sauce drizzled just right, fish flakes dancing in the rising heat, onions, and the whole thing atop a plate just a little bigger than the pancake. 

I could order it again. 

Overall:
I like the interior of the restaurant. It is very open and communal with a clean appearance. For a Toronto restaurant, I think the prices are very reasonable. I would go again and try something different. Although, I get the feeling that creativity gets in the way of actual taste.",1,0,0,positive

First off, great location. Love the decor & layout.  
Luckily the hype wore off pretty fast & most nights you don't need a reservation. But like most ramen places, the wait isn't too long.

The true reason why I come back are for the following: peach beer (collaboration with Oast House Brewers) & the pork belly buns. If I ever get dragged back to this place I'd probably just get that.

The service is mediocre and the food is good but definitely not worth the price. On this particular occasion we ordered: 
- Pork Buns ($10 for 2): there was plenty of meat and the buns were super soft and fluffy but I found it a bit bland. And at $5\/each there are many better options (think: Banh Mi Boys)
- Inari (raw beef with rice in a tofu-like pocket - $6): the beef was great but overall this dish was unappealing to me, likely because of the rice in it which was dry. Also, there is only one bite-sized pocket in a order so it is difficult to share and not worth it to order. 
- Chicken ramen: we decided to stray away from the usual pork ramen and tried the chicken. I was pleasantly surprised...the noodles were cooked perfectly, the chicken was very tender and the the toppings paired well. The broth was surprisingly not as salty as their pork ramen so that was a plus.  
- Ginger scallion noodles: this is a cold noodle dish with no broth and pickled veggies. I usually like this dish as it's a great alternative to the noodle soups. However, my noodles today were over-dressed..there was a pool of oil at the bottom so I was unable to finish it. 

I do enjoy the atmosphere\/venue - simple, modern and delicious treats within reach (Milk Bar). It can get a bit noisy and the tables here are communal so it will be difficult to have a private conversation.

Ambience: 3\/5
It was fine. Explosively busy for a Tuesday lunch time. I attribute that to summerlicious.   Very cool and trendy. We sat at a long bench-table on the main floor. It was nice to see the action going on in the kitchen, but it was also very crowded and noisy. 

Service: 3\/5
Also fine! The server was friendly, though slow (again, attributing that to the summerlicious). It took a long time to get our bills... but that seems to be a problem everywhere. 

Food: 4.5\/5
Got the: Salmon crudo- It was like a tiny piece of smoked salmon. Fresh, tasty, would have been better with a little kick. 
Tasted (from other member(s) of our party): Inari - not special, but good. Very standard inari. 

Got the: Southern fried chicken with ssam- two pieces of drumsticks, served with bib lettuce leaves, some kimchi (ssam?) and a mayo-dip thing. Was really good, despite my not liking drumsticks (I'm a breast-girl, I guess). Skin was crispy, but not greasy. Meat was juicy, sweet, and well seasoned. The mayo-dip thing paired well with the kim chi. Lettuce added a nice refreshing crunch to each bite. Great mix of textures and flavours. Also, everything came in great proportions (oddly important at times).
Tasted: Jjajang Noodle. Pretty good ramen, nice flavour. But I never understood this Toronto Ramen craze! It ingredients seemed fresh, and well proportioned. Noodles were a good texture, but it's all nothing my mom can't make! (Maybe my momma's just an amazing asian cook?). Anyway, I wasn't wow'ed by it by any means. 

Got the: Birthday cake truffle. Perfect end to a meal. A little, high quality sweet to finish off the meal. Crumbled away perfectly with each bite.
Tried: German chocolate truffle. Not a fan of the coconut covering, but pretty tasty! Rich and smooth, great texture.

Overall, awesome pick for summerlicious (16.95 after tax, before tip). Perfect amount of food; high quality. Personally, I wouldn't pay full price, due to my being horribly spoiled by my mom's cooking. Co-workers really enjoyed it, and I think if my dining companions called for it, I would go back.

Momofuku New York is cool, David Chang is over-rated and yes it's hipster to call a two-time Michelin-star restauranteur ""mediocre"", but if I had no idea what Momo was and just walked into the restaurant, ate the meal without any preconceived notions, I would be hard pressed to give this restaurant anything lower than a 4 star. 

Ever since relocating back to Toronto from Asia I have been forced to choose between wallet-burning sushi (Hashimoto, I'm still coming for you) or stomach-corrosive, msg-drenched Chinese take-out. 
Momofuku is my respite when I start to lose faith in the Asian food scene in Toronto (which is basically every single time I try a new Asian restaurant). 

Prices are very affordable, portions are fair and the broth is delectable. 
I thoroughly enjoy all of their noodle bowls, and leave the restaurant really content each time I dine here. 

I also love their corn cookies, despite not having a sweet tooth at all. It's a fun place to bring friends and the service is always excellent. 

It's also conveniently located in the Shangri-La, so I frequently top off my meals by heading to the lobby bar for drinks or tea while listening to live music.

Very delicious. I also ordered the spicy chicken bun. And for dessert: the soft serve ('cereal milk' flavoured). Very rich, very creamy. Served in those tiny dixie cups dentists have for your rinse.

I totally understand that you can't expect the same level of quality and service during Winter\/Summerlicious as what you would normally get, but the terrible experience I had here was frankly unacceptable by any standard. 

For the buns, we got the chicken meatball which lacked flavour and the BBQ pork which was flavourful but dry. This was followed by the beef udon which I had a really hard time eating. It had a really strong cumin flavour that I wasn't expecting as there was no mention of it on the menu. If a certain flavour is going to be that prominent in a dish, there's no excuse for not mentioning it on the menu. There was also supposed to be smoked yolk which was nowhere to be found in sight or in taste. The tan tan noodles my husband got was much better. For dessert (which they screwed up my order for), I got the panna cotta. It was way too firm for a panna cotta. While I like a bit of salt in my desserts to balance off the sweetness, I got punched in the mouth with huge specks of salt.

I wanted a chance to voice my discontent to the waiting staff, but never got a chance. A waitress came to take our bowls away. I thought seeing half the food left in my bowl would signal the waitress to ask how we found our food, but she was too busy to care. I tried telling her, but she walked off right away. I get she was busy with all the customers visiting for Winterlicious, but that's no excuse for ignoring your customers. If you're going to treat your customers like that and serve terrible food during Winterlicious, then maybe the restaurant should consider not doing Winterlicious at all.

I've been here before to try the Ramen and I also thought it was just okay. Small portions too. The decor is nice and open, has a casual trendy feel. The kitchen is open to the patrons so we can see what the cooks\/chefs are doing, which is cool. Service was quick and good as well. The food, however, could've been better for the price (especially during non-Summerlicious times). 

For Summerlicious (lunch), I tried the Salmon Crudo while others had the Inari. I can't comment on the Inari, but the presentation was nice. Apparently, it was almost like a tofu skin sushi roll with scallions on top. The Salmon Crudo seemed to be done to service (not ahead of time), tasted fresh but lacked overall seasoning. There was little smokiness flavour, could've used a little kick, and was a bit boring. There was some crunchy aspect with the baked\/fried nori, but no spicey kick to it all despite advertising habarnero ingredients. Next the Southern Fried Chicken with Ssam. Being Korean, I was interested in this but it is not similar to Korean style bo ssam at all. The fried chicken tasted fresh to order, had a nice crunch, clearly did not use typical Asian Panko breadcrumbs but used seasoned breadcrumbs (Southern American style) and the drumsticks were cooked nicely. I can't really describe the sauce, which was a nice complement to the seasoned fried chicken. It had some caramel flavour but almost reminded me of those Japanese salad dressings with a bit of nuttiness to it. Also the Kimchi was good to me because it had that fermented authentic taste to it. Altogether, the lettuce wrap with fried chicken + sauce + kimchi had a nice balance. I didn't think the combination would work but it worked! Finally, the strawberry lemon truffle was just okay and super sweet. The dessert was tiny compared to other restaurants and seemed to come out of a box. 

Overall, the food was just okay and reasonable for the $15 prixe menu but other than that, I expected better from friends' raves and reviews. My friends who tried the Summer chilled ramen said that was just okay as well. Service was good and our waitress was friendly and able to explain the menu to us.

The pork Secreto was paired with overpowering sauces that I could have used 10 more bib lettuces.  The flank steak was not of temperature and too chewy to the bite.  The best dish was the torn pasta as the minced chicken morsels reminded me of a great Pad Gra Pah Thai dish. The noodles should have had more torn texture as these were basically soft lasagna skins.  Chang uses fancy words like Sepia for cuttlefish and pretends it somehow makes the dish better but it does not.  These types of arrogance was all over the menu.

First it's an amazing building that the 3 level restaurants are located in. Simply stunning. We opted to eat in the Noodle bar as our first foray into David Chang's food. We ordered pork and shitake buns, one of the noodles, and the corn side dish. All were simply stunning. So stunning that we immediately talked about if we should eat anywhere else the rest of our stay. As for beverages- I had the Strawberry Field's cocktail, it didn't disappoint- strawberry deliciousness is more like it.

We also happened upstairs to check out the newly opened Milk Bar. Had to try the Crack Pie... We got a slice and it was good. Not outstanding, not addictive. Glad I tried it once.

I can only assume the markup on ramen (at $15 a bowl) is quite high and pays the rent at this Shangri-La-attached restaurant.  And for a restaurant with the word noodlebar in the namesake you would expect the noodles to be the pièce de resistance - nuh uh.

We nabbed a seat at the kitchen bar and it was a great spot to see all the staff meticulously putting together the dishes.  Everyone had a specified task - there was a buns guy, a noodle guy, and then the everything else guy.  David Chang's work ethic and perfection definitely shows in the way the kitchen is run.  He said during the TIFF talk that the mentality in Asia is to master the highest level in one said craft and do it for the rest of your life.  Looks like the bun guy will always be making the buns here!

We opted for the Momofuku Ramen ($15).  I figure if the restaurant is willing to put their name to the dish it must be damn good.  This is composed of pork belly + shoulder, fish cake, and egg.  I will say that the broth here is for the purists.  It is not as rich or intense as say Santouka, but the sweet flavours from the pork bone really makes it an untainted and ""pure"" broth.  The generous sprinkling of scallions for me was a plus and the perfectly poached egg manages to melt in your mouth like cotton candy.  

Like I said earlier, the ramen wasn't the showstopper - for me it was the Pork Buns ($10) served with hoisin, scallions and cucumber.  The measure of a good bun for me lies in the perfect ratio of protein to bun; the bun should be just the right amount of thickness so that the bun doesn't end up soggy and a good bun is also soft and supple.  The pork bun at Momofuku definitely met every criteria I seek in a pork bun.  It's great as is, but for those who like a little kick, don't be shy with the Sriracha ;)

The Smoked Chicken Wings ($12) are topped with pickled chili, fried garlic and scallions.  The glaze reminds me very much of a Teriyaki sauce.  I found the balance slightly off as the sugar component of the sauce was really prominent leading to an overly-sweet wing for me.

Another complaint I have is the cocktail list - they have 1 cocktail.  A G&T (Gin & Tonic).  Maybe the Shangri-La wants people to hang out in the hotel bar for drinks instead? 

With tax and tip our meal for 2 came to $46.50.  Not cheap.  I am not encouraged to come back again.  I may have come back for the pork buns (as a snack) if their cocktail list was a little more extensive.  The pork buns get 5 stars, but the overall restaurant is just standard, hence 3 stars in total. Oh and trying to find parking is a b!tch.",5,1,2,positive

What is there to say about entering the doors to the noodle bar? Busy, loud (not too loud though), delicious smells, and lively conversations happening all around. An ambiance that is familiar and welcoming.

First on the menu, the seven spice sour slushi - Awesome. Delicious,refreshing, and cold (the lovely architect student next to us found out how cold it was when my coworker spilled his on her, by accident of course).

Shortly after the event from above happened, our beautiful and oh-so-wonderful pork belly buns came out. What is there to say about them? Lovely balance of flavor and the bun\/pork belly just melt away when entering that mouth.

Sorry to say but the food standard at the Toronto location compared to NYC is just not there.  Even the attention to customer service and details lacks behind NYC.  Being to that site 3 times as well.
I am familiar with high standard of the shangri la chain of hotels in Asia and momofuku would be an embarrassment if this was in the major cities of HK, Singapore, etc.
The pork belly bao has got to kidding me....a big zero disappointment ....and I feel I am an expert on pork belly bao.  Simply overcooked such that the quality and texture of the meat if it weren't for the nice bun I would have left it on the plate!
The ramen was slightly better but lacks the wow effect compared to a couple of other local places in Toronto and definitely way surpassed by those in NYC and that includes momofuku NYC site as well. The noodle is chewy as it should be but the broth is weak (had the clam ramen).  Thankfully the fresh red chilli gave it the kick otherwise the broth was just okay.  
Getting our order took well over 10 min but food did arrive quite quickly.
Overall you come for the atmosphere but if you want better food the latter will likely be disappointing.",0,0,0,positive

I was alone and sat by the window and got some reading done before and after my meal.

I came back a couple of days later to find out that the restaurant is closed to public for a private luncheon.

I like the location - after all, at the foot of the Shangri-La is swanky, right? I was kind of surprised by the cafeteria style seating, but didn't really mind it because we got a spot facing outside on stools. Although it was very busy, I was still able to hold a conversation comfortably because of where my friend and I were seated.

The prices, at first glance, are fairly reasonable. The waitress pointed out that the mains were huge portions and recommended some appetizers\/things to share. We got the shiitake buns to share, while I ordered the Spicy Noodle and she got the Chicken & Egg rice dish.

I actually loved the shiitake buns. They were delicious, but when I realized there were two small buns for almost 10 bucks, it seemed a bit disappointing. I was looking forward to my main noodle dish, hoping for something just as tasty but a better portion.

Disappointed. Again.

The Spicy Noodle is too salty and kind of boring for what you pay. While it is labelled 'spicy', I found it overwhelming - and I eat very spicy Indian food on the regular. My face just felt hot and my tongue felt numb after a while. There is a proper way to do spicy, and then there is just slathering sriracha all over a package of Mr Noodle, which is what this kind of felt like.

My friend's rice dish was a bit better than mine (also, much bettter portion: it actually filled the bowl, while my bowl was about a third filled. Is that normal?) I'm a little sad that I would normally choose a 'safe' rice dish, but instead opted for a noodle dish while out at a noodle bar, only to feel shafted.

Overall, this place is cute looking from afar and has some nice decor. The waitress was nice (although maybe a little misleading...) and maybe there are better things on the menu. In my experience, if you want ramen, or a good bowl of noodles, hit up any other noodle joint like Ajisen Ramen where you can save your money and leave happy and full.",2,1,3,positive

We were told the wait was going to be 45 mins at 7:30 - by 8:15, we checked in with the host and he told us there will be another 25 min wait.  Fine... We ended up sitting in the Shangri-La lobby, wanted to order some drinks while we wait.  Right after we ordered our drinks, we got a text saying our table is ready and they will only hold our table for 10 mins.  When we get in to claim our table, we had to wait for another 20 mins!! As soon as we sat down, the waitress wanted to take our order before we can read the menu (i assume it's because they wanted their ""fast turnover"".... We told her we need another minute... She never came back.

It was extremely unprofessional and ridiculous how the host\/manager super underestimated the wait time.  We understand that it's a popular restaurant and it's busy... but the host and the manager should not have underestimated the wait time by so much.  Having known that the wait was going to be over 1.5 hour, we would've had our meal somewhere else.

During the meal... I had a ginger beer... one of the waitress mistakenly pour water into my glass.  She apologized and gave me another bottle.  When we get our bill, we were charged 2 ginger beers.  Apparently another waitress saw 2 bottles on the table and she punched in another order (assuming that her colleague forgot to enter the order) even though she wasn't the one who put the order through... talking about chaotic and lack of proper management....

onto the food:
Pork Buns:  It was generally good, but the bun was really soggy... not a fan...
Rice Cake:  this might be the best dish we have tried.  the rice cake was crispy on the outside.
Momofuku Ramen:  Disappointing... . the soup base (which is almost the most important thing in a bowl of ramen) was not flavorful and need more salt... I've had way better ramen at other japanese restaurants.

6 of us called ahead and ordered the fried chicken dinner - all Korean style. We got to the restaurant and decided to each get a snack - some pork buns, shitake buns, the char siu burger, and rice cakes.

Our snacks were served at the same time as our dinner, and they brought out one char siu burger half way through dinner. The char siu burger was delicious (and probably the only thing I would come back for). The chicken is delicious but I have had better fried chicken elsewhere. But really the biggest problem is the service. 

The server seemed completely disinterested in serving us, we kept having to flag him down to ask for food or water. You cannot get coffee - the noodle bar doesn't have a machine. Upstairs does but apparently you cannot cross from downstairs to upstairs as they exist in an alternate vortex. No seriously. The same bloody restaurant split into floors will not make a coffee on one floor and serve it to another floor. Stupid. They had similar issues with some of the alcohol that was ordered (but I wasn't paying attention cause I wanted my damn food).

The worst part of all was the pumpkin spice cake which we ordered for my friends birthday. We asked the server (before the cake was brought out) if there were any walnuts as he has a severe allergy. He said he would check. Then he brought out the cake - without telling us if there were walnuts. He said he would check again as he had to take the cake back to get it cut. 15 minutes later we got the cut cake, and confirmation of no walnuts. 

the cake was a salt lick - and I love salt and salty desserts. It was so salty, that we thought there must have been a mistake. When we pointed this out to the server he said ""well its the pumpkin spice"" - ummm no, pumpkin spice does not have salt in it. He then just proceeded to say its supposed to be a salty sweet dessert  - and left. No ""let me check"", no ""can I offer you another dessert"" - nothing. And this cake was SO salty that none of us finished our pieces and left it half eaten on the plate.

I went in for the Winterlicious lunch, and ordered the pork bun, smoked chicken ramen, and the compost cookie.

I loved the ramen broth (it had a lot more body to it than I was expecting) and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I have to say I wasn't a fan of the mushrooms in the dish. I love mushrooms, but found that the sweetness of the shiitakes clashed with the other flavors in the dish. They were easy to avoid, though, as they were all placed to one side of the bowl. 

When it came time for dessert, I was a little disappointed to receive a hard, boring cookie after hearing so much hype about Milk Bar. The guy next to me ordered the chocolate pudding, which had a nice presentation and looked a lot better than my cookie.

The restaurant is also kind of cramped--you share tables with other other parties so it's kind of like a (noodle) bar organized restaurant. 

I have to say, the food was unappetizing, except for the rice cakes (but it was overpriced at three spoonfuls for $11). The ginger scallion noodles and the potato dashi ramen had no taste and the pork ramen's broth and the extremely spicy noodles were way over seasoned, especially the latter. We asked the waiter for hot water but they did not have any so she offered extra pork broth as an alternative. That, however, did not help because the broth was sodium in a bowl. Moreover, we were charged for the broth even though it was offered as an alternative for water. 

The menu was also very confusing. I added Katsu to my noodles, which was $4 extra, but they don't specify which meat it is. I assumed it was going to be pork, since ""Katsudon"" is fried pork cutlet over rice, but instead it was chicken, which I do not eat. 

The food was served quickly but we got some nasty attitude from the server. In addition, they were very peculiar about getting every cent out of their visitors. Do not recommend and will not be coming back here.

Yes there was a lot of hype about this place and it may have really gotten ppl's expectations up, but I thought the food definitely lived up to my own expectations.

My partner and I went on the 2nd day that it opened and were seated within 20mins. Granted it was a Thursday and the line wasn't too insane at around 5:30. The service was super friendly, unpretentious, and left us with a great impression to begin with.

We ordered the momofuku ramen, the chicken and egg, and pork buns. My partner's favourite was the chicken and egg bowl, which came with a perfectly half-cooked egg that you break and mix into the rice. The winner of this dish was definitely the smoked chicken, which had a nice thin crispy skin with a pretty intense smoky flavour.  It was a smart twist on the conventional oyako don\/bibimbap.

I myself loved the momofuku ramen. The noodles were a tad on the chewy side but I enjoyed this texture very much. The soup base was definitely a bit different from what you'd taste in an orthodox bowl of japanese ramen - it had a lot of flavour, was not too salty or heavy, and pulled all the ingredients in the bowl together. I loved the crunch of the cabbage and the hint of alcohol in it...went very well with the richness of the 2 kinds of pork found in the ramen - pork belly and pulled pork. 

We both LOVED the pork buns too and wish we had a bit more room in our tummies.  The meat was cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection and was incredibly fragrant and flavourful, definitely NOT dressed in the same sauce as what you'd taste in the broth of the ramen.

The communal seating didn't bother us either. It's typical of noodle bars like this and can be pretty interesting when you're seated across strangers.

The cocktails were $12.

This place definitely has a 'hip' atmosphere.  Communal benches, a nice lounge area upstairs, open kitchen.  It caters mainly to non-asians who probably want: chic atmosphere, western quality service and a pure english menu with staff who can explain it.

Now, if it's one of my favorite restaurants, you ask, why am I giving it four stars instead of five? I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the food, which is almost always flawless.

On this visit, I ate:

Roasted Rice Cakes (""red chili, onion, sesame""): This is a reliable standby for me, as I order it most times I eat here. I did, however, inform our server that we wanted to start with this dish as an appetizer, but of course, it arrived at the same time as the mains. Still, it was as delicious, flavorful, and addictive as ever.

Extremely Spicy Noodle (""sichuan chili, zha chi, scallion""): I love how every time I order this, I get a warning of its heat level. Yes, it's *extremely* hot, but it also packs a hell of a punch in terms of flavors. The small glass of soy milk that accompanies the dish is certainly appreciated.

Maple-Pecan-Coconut cookie: I found out afterwards that this is actually a vegan cookie and I had absolutely no idea. It's definitely softer than your average cookie, but the prominent maple flavor is impossible to resist and the coconut-heavy texture complements it quite well.",1,0,0,positive

Here is what I'll say about this. Is this your everyday affordable greasy comforting ramen? No. Is this your ""I'm going to treat myself"" ramen? Yes. 

What you're getting at Momofuku isn't just about a bowl of noodle, soup, and pork. Its carefully crafted using higher quality ingredients with some minor twists of the chef's palette. It isn't just a bowl, its an experience. So is it worth it? Yes. It is everyday? No.

I came here twice in a week, here is what I did:

Meal #1: Double Ordered Fried Chicken Day!

- Fried Chicken: 9\/10 - The Korean version is superior! Crispy, moist, the skin could be eaten like its a chip! Accompanying condiments and chive pancakes are filling! This is a FEAST!
- Momofuku ramen: 9\/10 Again, once in a while treat yourself ramen. Great runny egg, good portion of food though! Plenty of meat to spare. You can get filled by this!
- Clam ramen: 10\/10 Wow! Great depth of flavor, love the spice! Nice heat and the soup is intended to be a thick sauce that is absorbed by the ramen. If you wonder why you're broth looks skim, its intentional.
- Okonomiyaki: 8\/10 Pretty good, I prefer mind more traditionally prepared and served.
- Oxtail: 7\/10 Personally, not my favorite cut of meat. Sauce was great and flavorful
- Pork buns: 10\/10 UGHH...lots of fatness and juice, so simple and well executed.
- Soft Serve: 8\/10 I couldn't believe how much I loved this. Get the Cereal milk with cornflakes. The coffee flavored one is pretty strong, I preferred cereal milk.
- Service: 4\/10 Nonexistent, a bit pretentious at time. When our main server was around, he was nice, but finding him was hard. Then he claimed that none of the servers are assigned tables, its a free for all. Whatever.

Meal #2: Normal ramen day

- Momofuku Ramen: See Above
- Orange popsicle slushy: 6\/10 Its not bad, just nothing I'd get again.
- Cereal Milk soft serve: See Above
- Service: 2\/10 Our server was really clueless, nonexistent, moody, pretentious, and just plain awful. You're bored of your job, we can tell! He contradicted himself a few times and didn't even notice. Dumb.

So overall, I loved the food! I'm glad I did it and I'd do it again when I'm traveling here. However, the service is as chilly as the winter weather outside. Thank goodness the ramen is hot enough to melt some of that ice cold service away.",0,3,0,positive

Food were served and we start to dig in. As a big fan of ramen I'm so excited to try the broth. Broth needs more flavor and the noodles was okay. Overall, taste of the ramen is bland.  There was no kick, no impact, and no special thing about the ramen.  

However, staff are really nice and they were able to accommodate our huge group. Good job on that.

Momofuku is adjacent to the Shangri-La hotel, which is where we were staying. This was a good place for a light meal at the end of our day.

Pork buns were delicious. The pork slices were definitely fatty, but that's what made them so good! The sauce, scallions, and cucumber were a great touch!

The Momofuku ramen was very meh. The noodles were cooked nicely; the perfect al-dente consistency. In my book, there are few things more evil than soggy noodles. I was just craving a traditional miso broth or thick pork broth, so I felt disappointed at the flavor profile of their Momofuku broth. Note - the egg is a softly poached egg, not a soft-boiled egg (which I would've preferred.) Keep in mind that once you break the yolk, it will change the flavor of the broth.

We also tried the Ginger Scallion ramen (veg) which had shittake mushrooms and cabbage. I liked this one a lot, but it felt a bit more like a salad appetizer. It didn't come with broth.

The okonomiyaki was very disappointing. It was far too salty, and just tasted like they piled mayo and oyster sauce on top of a regular pancake. Bleh.

For the food you're getting, Momofuku is fairly expensive, and there are a ton of Japanese-themed restaurants in the region better deserving of your money. I might return to try the ice cream, but probably nothing else.

Shiitake buns: Toothsome mushrooms in a slightly over-salted sauce. Have the pork buns first and these second.

Reuben buns: these were a misfire. Nothing wrong, but I didn't like the more sour, vinegary overall taste. The pastrami wasn't up to the task of matching the level of sour. The cheese didn't do much either.

Chicken & egg on rice w\/ quick pickled cukes and green onions. Mush up the runny poached egg w\/ the rice, add some salt and go to town. The chicken skin was crisp and the meat was flavorful. I'd get this again.

Smoked chicken wings: Smoked wings fried crisp and tossed w\/ a salty-sweet sauce and topped w\/ fried garlic and green onions. These weren't too smoky, but were very flavorful, had a nice chew and are worth a repeat order. Hours later and I'm still burping up the garlic.

Back to the noodle bar. My two favourite things on the menu are the Pork Buns and Momofuku Ramen. As mentioned in several other reviews, the Pork Buns are incredible. I always get some every time I go. The dough is so soft and the pork is unbelievably juicy. Only downside is that they're pretty small and you only get two for the $10 price tag. Nonetheless, I'd still say they're a must-try.

The Ramen is quite good too. Out of all the places that serve ramen downtown, Momofuku has my favourite thus far as the taste is just so good. It comes with a poached egg on the surface that is super soft and tasty. It's a large serving too so this definitely hits the spot.

Only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the table seating and how close you sit to other guests.

I first tried Momofuku for Winterlicious 2015(?). My dining partner and I got the sesame scallion noodles and the Momofuku Ramen, based on our server's recommendation. Both were underwhelming - you can get so much better ramen at numerous places all over Toronto.

I visited Momofuku again last week with my work lunch crew. The bunch of us got a variety of dishes, such as the Buffalo chicken buns, Chicken Tan Tan Ramen, and Momofuku Ramen. Those that got the Momofuku Ramen agreed places like Kinton were far and beyond better. The Chicken Tan Tan Ramen was meh - I feel like it should have been specified that it's more of a dry ramen than anything. The egg on the dish didn't blend with the noodles, the sauce was bland and just spicy?
My biggest regret while eating here was agreeing to split the Buffalo Chicken Buns with one of my coworkers. Biggest waste of money ever - you can get better baos for much cheaper.

The one thing you can rely on at Momofuku is bad service. Every time I've visited, everyone from the hostess, to waitress, to servers have been plain rude. On my most recent visit, the waitress felt the need to eyeroll our group, and the server who brought us the buns was adamant that he was right when he brought us pork buns instead of chicken.

First time was a busy dinner night. At that point, they weren't taking reservations (not sure if they've changed that policy) so the wait was pretty long (about an hour). After we were finally seated, the server seemed pretty agitated, annoyed, and rushed when we were giving her our orders. It was a pretty busy night, but shouldn't be an excuse for the way we were treated. We were a group of 6, so a little larger than usual but we were very easy with our orders.

The food is not bad. We ordered a bunch of different baos and rice balls called onirigi as starters to share. The baos were okay, but the onigiris were great! Too bad they're not on the menu anymore. We all had the regular ramen which was very underwhelming. I had heard how great the noodles were but thought the broth, while very rich, was just not very good...It was lacking something, I just can't put my finger on it. Not to mention that prices are higher than other ramen places. On another occasion, I had the spicy cold noodles which were MUCH better than the regular ramen. If you end up going, I suggest trying their other more creative bowls and save your money for a better bowl of traditional ramen elsewhere. Food was edible but nothing that really stands out, besides the onigiri which is sadly no longer available. Service felt pretty rushed, which makes sense with a poppin' place like that with many people waiting to be seated, but I think everyone should be given a chance to enjoy their meal without feeling hurried, especially when they're not even close to overstaying the time limit.

The main dining room was full, so we ventured up to the upstairs bar. Service was great and friendly from the bartender. 

The green iced tea was delicious-- it came with giant ice cubes and a slight, sweet kick. 

I also enjoyed the Ginger Scallion Noodles-- the noodles were cooked to perfection, light, and not greasy! The sauce was delicious-- some noodles, sauce, mushrooms, and pickled cucumbers was the perfect bite!

I finished up with chicken bun-- flavors were on-point and similar to a chicken karaage style texture!

Being foodies, we had watched David Chang's documentaries on Netflix so we were very much looking forward to trying the new restaurant. It was obviously packed when we initially came so we were more than happy to wait. I had a box of cupcakes with me that we bought to bring home and sample for our wedding. Before being seated, the hostess said we could not bring in the cupcakes and she proceeded to leave them on a ledge at the front cash. Then she sat us in front of the door right beside her hostess station. 

I didn't get a very hospitable vibe from this. All she needed to say was, ""we don't allow outside food to be eaten at our facility"". It seemed unnecessary to ask us to leave our purchase, when trying to offer a classy upscale Noodle bar vibe. It's the same feeling you get when you walk into a store and they ask you to leave your bag at the cash. For such a nice upscale restaurant, it cheapened the whole experience for me.

We also tried a lot of different styles of ramen on our travels and I thought this place was over rated. The broth was mediocre - not what I was expecting of the David Chang brand. We haven't written this restaurant off - we may try it again eventually.

We knew coming here that there was alot of hype surrounding the place, especially after the media has been selling this place nonstop.  Since it wasn't busy yesterday we tried our luck today.  

Arrived at 6:30 and was told it was an hour wait, they take your number and text you when your table is ready.  They say you can go anywhere but when your reservation comes up, your entire party needs to be there within 10 minutes or the reservation is gone.  We decided to go to Shoppers at Peter and King St and just got the text when we went in, we quickly got out and we were three minutes late getting to the restaurant.  Needless to say our reservation was given to someone else and we grudgingly made another one.  They said it was an hour wait but we were called about 45 mins later.

Well, once you get called, the guy buzzes you in (you can't just walk in, this place is too cool and exclusive to let any common people just walk right in).  You get to another set of heavy doors and then have to wait for your table to clear out.  

Let's just say, all ramen noodle places must have a cramped, pack you in like sardines mentality because this place is just that.  It's communal benches and good luck if you have a backpack or shopping with you because there's no place to put it.

Service is fast, they want you in and out in thirty minutes.  Problem is that not all the food arrives at the same time.  I wanted to try a few things so we got

Smoked Chicken Wings

Pork Buns $10 for 2
Chicken Buns $10 for 2
Momofuku Ramen Noodles $14
Chicken and Egg (we both thought it was with ramen but it turns out it was served with rice). $15
Smoked Chicken Wings $12


I'd have to say the best thing was the smoked chicken wings, there's a bit of spice to it.

I don't get what all the hype over the pork buns is.  Basically if you have ever gone to Banh Mi Boys, it's two small pieces of pork belly, hoisin sauce and I think scallions (green onions for us regular folk).  They are pretty small that's for sure.

We didn't eat the chicken ones, at that point we were full but the meat was cut into small pieces.  Not much for presentation

The Ramen noodles were ok, I guess it's better than Kinton but nothing that special to write home about.

Chicken and Egg rice, it's served with scallions and what can I say...it tastes like the chicken terriyaki lunch special at Ho Su or even the chicken and rice small take out at T&T supermarket.  Uninspiring.

The service was ok, not a fan of our server but the runners were nice.  If you have special requests, don't come here!  I asked if we could get the hoisin sauce on the side for the chicken buns, she asked if it was a food allergy and when I told her it wasn't but that I'm not a fan of sauce, it seemed like they don't make special requests here.  She asked me if the cooks couldn't accomodate if I still wanted sauce, I told them to just put a little.  Well, long after the chicken buns arrived, the server told me they put just a little bit of hoisin sauce on the chicken buns (little late for that now).

Overall I find the food runners to be nicer than the servers.  What made my eyes bulge out was the $4 we were charged for the 236ml of coke we ordered.  Some lady close to us managed to get a full sized can of diet coke with ICE, yet we were just given our coke in the customary fancy bottle.  It would have been nice to have gotten a glass of ice to make it seem like we were getting a reasonable amount of coke!  Geez, next time I""ll just get water!

i remember coming here quite some time ago and i found their food okay. i have tried their ramen, some kind of kimchi dish i don't remember, and pork buns. 

first of all, i thought their ramen was pretty atrocious. $16 and the amount given was just, no. such a huge bowl was used and the ramen didn't even fill up halfway. it won't even fill up like 1\/3 of my stomach. it also didn't help that i was sharing it too. like mate you cant be charging us that much so such a small portion?!?! oh, and about the taste, it was mediocre. definitely could've been better. to me, it didn't really taste like the ramen you would get at i don't know, let's say sansotei ramen. there are better places to get ramen so yep. if you're coming here for some good ol' ramen, this aint the place for you. 

moving on to the mystery kimchi dish that i have no recollection of what it was. i don't think it's even on the menu anymore, but regardless it wasn't very good. the kimchi was quite bitter for my taste and overall, the flavours dont go well. i wish i remember what it was but all i remember was that it wasnt good!!! 

now ahaaa! saved the best for last. their pork buns were de~~~licious. i am actually not a huge fan of fatty pork but ooo the pork along with the bun was just soxiownsjkixjxixos. it just melts into your mouth once you bite into it. definitely recommend this over all of the things i have tried. 

so yeah considering i only liked one thing from here... you can tell i wasnt a huge fan of this place ..but i don't know if you really want to give this place a shot, definitely try their pork buns. you will not regret the only regret youll ever have is leaving the place withouttttt trying dem pork buns 

oh yeah i forgot to mention but i remember getting charged a total of $5 for water. yes, y'all heard (or read) me. FIVE freaking dollas for watah!!! we were given sparkling? water in the beginning and the server didnt say anything at all that it was $2.50. like how dare you?!? YOU THINK you can be SLY like that and not tell us. anyways because the water we got didnt taste that good we asked for regular water and yeah das right becauze we didnt know it costed money we added another $2.50 to our bill. what a glorious day!!! we spent $5 on water i couldve boought a happy meal with that money but nope ..it was spent on water....",2,1,2,positive

The Momofuku Ramen was OK, the broth seemed nicely balanced in taste. But I thought the noodles were too soft, and I like a slightly more cooked egg (vs. a practically raw yolk with little egg white). The pork was too fatty for me. Kimchi was a nice touch.

The pork buns were very disappointing. Again, the pork was too fatty, and overall it was kinda bland. Expensive too ($10 for two buns). Banh Mi Boys kick their butt in this area. 

Lastly, service was terrible. I was there on Jan 3 around 1 pm, wasn't that busy. Sat at the noodle counter and it took forever to place my order. Doesn't help that the waiters are dressed in regular clothes, kept confusing them with dining customers. I didn't find them friendly or hospitable.

Extreme Spicy Noodles was by far the best ethnic spicy and perfect to enjoy on a cold night. If you are one of those people that perspire during spicy eats, this will get you going. This dish has no soup to it spice intensity is there. It also comes with a shot of unsweeten soy milk to cool the palette.

The Winter Ramen, apparently how they cook their egg is amazing (according to him). Based on what I tasted, it's OK. The broth is on the lighter side, more like Chinese style broth as oppose to other ramen places that I frequent. 

I did appreciate that they sell Ontario Spring Water Sake on their menu for going local.

Yes, I know that it's expensive for ramen. But it's not expensive for a nice restaurant (and a celebrity chef one, to boot) and it *so good.* You can have an app or maybe two and a couple of mains and still walk out of here paying less than $30\/person, especially if you don't mind sticking with water. If you have a drink you will be pushed easily into $$$ range.

The place is very, very trendy and cool but Noodle Bar is casual enough that you won't feel totally out of place in normal street clothes.

A Momofuku pork bun is probably the best food you can get for $5. If they made them pizza size I would find a way to fit them in my mouth. We've tried to replicate them at home with some success but they're just never the same as they are at Noodle Bar. The wings are very good, cold smoked and pan fried rather than breaded and deep fried, and worth trying.

Noodle Bar does not take reservations, but they will text you when a table is ready for you, so you can either take off and wait somewhere nearby or head up to the (rather expensive) cocktail lounge on the second floor of the Momofuku complex (for lack of a better term). 

The service is extremely friendly, professional and efficient.

I'm not sure if the cold spicy noodles change from day-to-day or if New York Noodle Bar just does theirs differently. Here I had them with a spicy black bean sauce that was dialed back quite a bit from what I experienced in NYC. It was still topped with that delightful szechuan pork sausage and candied cashews, though.

He had the congee, which was creamy and delicious, like a pork belly and scallion risotto.

I went in a group of 6 and we all really enjoyed it.  It's a messy experience, they cover your table in brown paper before you sit down to catch all the stuff that falls onto the table (which is a lot).

The fried chicken is the best I've ever had.  They fry it twice and it is so crunchy and delicious.  There are two types: korean bbq style with spicy glaze and southern style.  Both with very different flavor profiles.  The chicken comes with a bunch of mu shu pancakes to roll it in, lettuce to wrap it in, pickled veggies and several different sauces.  I was in food heaven.

We paired it with some beer.   To start we each got a pork belly bun. We also got 3 sides : brussels sprouts, toasted rice cakes, and okonomiyaki (yam pancake thing).  The pork belly buns were good and the sides were tasty, but we got way too much food. I think the fried chicken and 1 side would have been plenty.  We took a bunch home.

The chicken was juicy and tender (2 large pieces) and the huge portion of mushrooms layered on top was delicious (marinated in a wine sauce perhaps???). Broth not as thick as some Ramen places but still good and not too salty. I also enjoyed the fresh noodles. Bottom Line - A GOOD bowl of Ramen.

My friend ordered the roasted rice cakes as a side - very good. Slightly crispy on the outside, soft inside with a mild kick at the end. Served with red chili, onion and sesame. A perfect side for Ramen. 

I will be back for sure...

 Smoked  chicken ramen : I skipped the egg it was good although I had to add hot sauce  due to my long time force of habit hotsauce and ramen just mesh well together 

Chicken Bao: Amazing flavours and texture I wish they gave us 2 it was soft crunchy spicy goodness.The bun was so soft snd fresh tasted like it was just made while we were waiting for it

The Soft Serve was a salty mess Thank Goodness I ate it last I drank a sip of my coke and it was just gross skip the soft serve at all costs it basically almost ruined my meal. I want to try the other 2 restaurants in the Shangri-La  before I go back to the noodle bar.",0,0,0,positive

I should of known something was up when the server's suggestion at a noodle bar was the ""chicken wings"". Regardless I ordered, and they tasted horrible; it tasted like cough medicine. The pork buns I dont know what the craze is it was nothing special just another way for them to use the pork. The pork was the only thing that was standard; if you cant get pork right then there really is nothing to say.  The atmosphere is really nice and gives a very luxurious vibe; as it should parking around University is flat rate $20. The menu is extremely overpriced $18 for a ramen?! are you kidding me?

We had a table for 13 and ordered multiple fried chicken dishes along with lots of extra dishes (rice cakes were good, pork buns are always good, ramen was ok but pricey for what it was). This was 5:20pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was half empty, no one really seated around our large party. It was slightly dim in the restaurant at the time and so I put the flash on to take a picture of my mom and her presents. After 2 pictures one of the hostesses told me to stop taking pictures because of the flash. Without flash my pictures become unfocused so this was very disappointing. My mom loves photos on her birthday. I could understand if it were a busy place and people were bothered by a cancer survivor opening up her presents on her birthday but I really didn't see a problem with this. But oh well!

4.5 stars - Momofuku graciously invited me back, and I was a lot more happy with the service and food I received. I came here with my sister, who had never been to Momofuku, to try some of their foods. 

We were seated on the second floor, which offered a gorgeous view of the outside. I'm not sure if this is available for normal visitors, but I loved dining from an elevated position that allowed us to people watch.

We ordered the roasted rice cakes, pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, and they also presented us with a special dish - their twist in Korean bbq.

The roasted rice cakes had an amazing texture. The crispness of the outside paired with the pillowy inside of the rice cakes made for an amazing appetizer. It was a little under seasoned though, and I almost found myself wishing that there was a dip for it on the side perhaps.

The pork buns, as always, were simply amazing. This is hands-down the best item on their menu. I know people rave about it constantly, but if you need to choose something to order, try their buns!! My sister was wide-eyed when she had one and loved it.

The ginger scallion noodles were tasty, but greasy. The noodle texture had a great elasticity and provide a good bite. The seasoning itself, on first bite, was amazing. However, I felt that it could use more ginger to provide more to the dish. After 2 or 3 bites, the oil starts coating your mouth, so the flavour of ginger would really help to reset your palate. There just wasn't enough ginger to help cut through the grease.

The cold Korean bbq was beautifully presented, and in a fun DIY manner that it's known for. It was served with gochujang on the platter, a medium rare steak, and vibrant greens. The steak was beautifully cooked, but again, it could've used another punch of flavour. The steak wasn't seasoned well enough for that extra impact. I feel like this could've pushed it over the edge if it had slightly better seasoning.

We also had drinks with our meal, the paper crane and a melon drink. Paper crane was a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but the melon drink was a fantastic one. I'd also like to add that our service was AMAZING! Shout out to our waitress!

Our meal ended with their famous cereal milk soft serve, which I always get when I visit. 

Overall, service was amazing, ambience was amazing, and the food just needed some minor tweaking for my tastes. Apart from that, I am super excited to come back and visit again now that I know what to order with confidence.

We were very excited to try this restaurant based on chef Chang's great reputation. But I am sad to say that we were pretty disappointed with the overall experience.

FOOD - we ordered pork buns to start which were delicious. I had a ginger beer which was in a bottle made by a Canadian company, which was really nice. My friends had the peach ale which they said was good. I ordered the pumpkin ramen and my husband ordered the momofuku ramen. Pumpkin one was a nice rich, comforting broth. But noodles were disappointing. Not cooked enough (and I like mine al dente), so was slightly hard. Pumpkin felt raw and didn't have much flavour. The momofuku ramen was pretty disappointing. Broth was clean, but nothing special to boast. Definately neither were worth the price. 

ATMOSPHERE - was nice. We had to wait 45min for a table of 4 on a Friday night at 8. Vibe was great. 

SERVICE - pretty terrible. We waited forever for someone to approach us after we sat down. Didn't even get a glass of water until 15-20minutes later. And he didn't even apologize. We also waited for him to bring the machine for our bill. But he never came back after dropping off our bill so we just ended up going to the host to pay. 

Overall, not a great experience. Nice space to hang with friends, but definately overpriced food that was not exceptional by any means. I feel like we have better ramen at our local go-to spots in Vancouver.",0,0,0,positive

Turns out the kimmari is fried (japchae wrapped with a seaweed and then fried). It was served with a spicy, tangy sauce (I think it was sriracha) which really helped with the flavour. I had a bite of the bun, which was very flavorful as well.
The sake don was very complex in flavour! The dill added a nice kick to the sushi rice, the salmon was yummy, and the avocado (my one true love) was delicious. I also tried the ginger scallion noodles, which was slightly oily but tasted exactly as it sounds. My friend also loved his mapo noodle, which is great!
I had mixed feelings about its cereal milk soft serve... I understand that it is Momofuku's signature product, but I just couldn't get over the saltiness and similarity to my bowl of milk after finishing the corn flakes. The flavour grew on two of my friends... just not me!
My friends then bought me the bday truffles and crack pie. Though I have yet to try the crack pie, the bday truffles tasted like cookie dough, icing, and timbits all in one. My family joked, however, that it looked like beef meatballs. Overall, I found it slightly too sweet for my liking!",1,1,1,positive

(I have had ramen at a non-ramen place, but I'm not sure that counts.)

Setting:  Restaurant itself isn't big, it just has super-high ceilings.  And even though the seating's communal, on benches, you don't really notice that you're sharing a table.  I'm sure this place is prettier at night, but I went for an early dinner.

Service:  I guess it's more attentive than a place that serves $8 ramen, with my water being refilled.  It did take a while for the waiter to collect our bills.  Waiter also gave us separate bills without any hassle which was nice.

Food...

Iced Sencha - $5, non-alcoholic.  It tasted like a rotten citrus fruit.  Not my thing.  Skip it!

Pork (belly) bun - $10\/2.  Lacking a bit of taste, I felt like I needed the sriracha provided.  Bun was soft with just the right amount of sweetness.  As expected, the pork belly is quite fatty.  I would suggest that if you're getting ramen with pork belly, get a different kind of bun as it's a bit much.

Momofuku Noodles - $15.  Good size.  As per the Yelp review, looked just like the NYC serving!  Satisfying mix of flavours\/textures.

If you wanna try this place out, don't really want to shell out that much $$$, and don't mind looking ghetto, you can share a bowl of noodles\/buns\/etc.  I saw a couple do this and no one seemed to care.

Anyways from the outside, the restaurant looked quite nice with the glass walls and huge decorative tree for that oriental feel. The interior didn't disappoint, everything looked very modern and clean with wooden tables. I didn't know this before but there's actually different momofuku restaurants in that one building. Each level offers a different dining area, it seems that the more fancier\/higher end dining were on the upper floors. The ground floor is only for the noodle bar which is where we ate. We were seated at the counter with the high stools so I had a perfect view of their open kitchen. The menu wasn't very extensive consisting of mainly small appetizers and noodles. I ordered the Momofuke ramen (I figured it has the name of the restaurant in it so can't go wrong) and my friend ordered the chilled ramen. The speed of service was decent, we didn't need to wait long for our food to arrive. I thought the presentation of the ramen was quite nice. There were two pieces of seaweed, one egg, two pieces of pork, spicy cabbage, A LOT of scallions and a special sauce in the center of the bowl. I actually quite liked the soup base, it wasn't too salty which is a common problem with many of the ramen I've had. It's slightly spicy which I think is due to the cabbage. The texture of the ramen is more on the firm side which I personally like. I was most impressed with how they cooked the egg. It's slightly raw in the inside without being too runny while still being able to keep it's shape. The pork is quite tender but it does have a thick layer of fat. I thought the portion was just right however it is more on the pricey end for ramen ($15). I also tried the chilled ramen and I was quite impressed with the soup base, it reminded me of the soup for udon. However, there wasn't any meat and I found the portion to be smaller than the momofuku ramen even if the chilled ramen was pricier ($16). 

I would rate the momofuku ramen to be more 3.5 than a 3. I would definitely recommend first comers to order the momofuku ramen to get your moneys worth.

I tried the BBQ pork bun, tasted the chicken bun and had a chicken ramen. My gf had the rice with salmon. See pics. I loved the BBQ pork bun. It was tasty, tender, salty sweet inside a fluffy open face steamed bun with coke slaw. Yeah, sounds weird but it works! The chicken bun was pretty good too but the texture was really soft. 

My ramen was not what I expected. The chicken was in small ground up pieces and not sliced as I anticipated. Although odd, it was still tasty. The veggies were tender and the broth had a good kick. The green onions were excessive  so I scraped them off. My gf enjoyed her salmon on rice but it wasn't anything unique in taste or texture. High marks for a pretty presentation.

Came here tonight with a few other people, and what a shame. Ginger Scallion noodles were so oily, the fat noodles were undercooked and the crab was shredded up into strands. Understandably the extreme spicy noodles were extremely spicy. But in the sense that it just seemed like they just threw handfulls of chiliflakes\/thai chilli and what ever spicy ingredient they can find. I enjoy really spicy food, and the noodles were not enjoyable. Especially at that price point. Its nice they give you a little shot glass of soy milk, to wash away the spiciness however be warned, they will charge you $2.00 if you ask for an extra glass. 

Its too bad, food could be fun and work in Toronto, but the price points need to be adjusted to the quality of food.

There were a lot of bartenders hanging out behind the bar but took a bit of effort to get their attention, they did create a great cocktail though. 

I received a text message saying my table was ready and that it would be held for 10 minutes. I misread it as my table would be ready in 10 minutes, so went down after 15 to ask the hostess why I hadnt received a followup text message. She clarified my misunderstanding and told me it wasnt an issue and that I should assemble my party (group of 4) and my table would be ready shortly.

We leave the bar and wait at the entrance and are told that the group sitting at our table has paid but is not making any effort to leave. I ask the hostess if she can say something to the group about the line and she says no. We wait for over 45 minutes at which point we see multiple groups leave (including pairs sitting beside each other) AND a group of 5 leave. We ask to be seated at the 5 person table and are told that the table is for 5 people and they cant waste a seat. I point out that 2 other tables are using empty seats as bag rests to which the hostess is non responsive.

We got the chicken and pork buns, frankly Banh Mi Boys tastes better, larger portions and cheaper. We all got the Momofuku Ramen and its disappointing, the fish cake tastes like mock crab and there is a large helping of Kimchi in the bowl. 

As soon as we are done paying, the waitress comes and tells us that the hostess would like to let us know there is a lineup for seats and that we are welcome to move to the Shangri-La lounge. 

The food is decent, but definitely not worth the wait and dealing with the inept staff. If there was NO line, I may return, but most probably would walk the 1.5 blocks to Kinton.",3,0,0,positive

Restaurant was very energetic and lively and staff was very friendly. 

1) Pork Ramen
- Soup was light compared to other ramen shops, I think its a seafood-based broth opposed to a chicken\/pork broth.  A bit bland for my liking
- Noodles were firm and had the ""bounce""
- Egg was very soft, Not a big fan
- THE PORK BELLY THOUGH, this is why this place gets 4 stars ("" Yay! I'm a fan - Yelp, 2017"")  Each belly slice is a cm thick so it's very hearty contrasting the soup.  When you put it into your mouth, you actually forget you are eating pork belly because you achieve meat nirvana.  It just melts and disintegrates in your mouth as you try to chew it.  But you can't chew it because you already swallowed it and are about to take another bite.
-The pork belly comes with a friend in the form of pulled pork shoulder, which is a nice alternative to the traditional sliced shoulder

2) Pork Belly Bao
So after I had the ramen, I needed more belly in my belly so I ordered another signature, the pork bun.
-Same reaction as above for the pork
-Overall though, the sweetness of the bun itself and the hoisin sauce compliment the pork belly sauces better than the ramen.

Place is pricier than other ramen stores, but can't blame them since they are doing some weird mystic stuff to that pork belly of theirs.

The menu isn't very large, but the items on the menu are all very unique and taste delicious!!! The menu also changes daily so you might be surprised to find new things on your next visit to try! 

I have tried three different noodles from the Noodlebar: Squash Tsukenen, Sichuan Noodle and Fiddlehead Noodle. All three were wonderful, but both the squash and fiddlehead noodles really rocked my world. I have also tried the bbq pork buns and the pork belly buns and my personal favourite is the bbq buns between the two. I have also tried the Okonomiyaki which is very good and has a tangy sauce, though it's best to share with another person as an appetizer. My boyfriend always gets the Momofuku ramen which he insists is the best thing he's ever tasted. 

I've also had some of their soft serve which was very tasty, but very overpriced for the portion they give you. It was 6 dollars for a shot sized cup and a couple cornflake pieces. Still no qualms about the taste though!

We really enjoyed it and was very excited to learn that he had a location here in Toronto. The website let's you book a reservation online, though it doesn't guarantee private seating as they have communal tables and a long counter that wraps around half the restaurant with bar stools. It has a cozy romantic type of atmosphere with dimmed lights. If you sit at the counter along the kitchen, you get to watch the chefs cook and plate some of the dishes. They're efficient and very clean. The servers have always been very polite but not really social when connecting with guests. At times it is confusing to determine who the hostess is as they seem to always be in regular casual clothing (i.e. jeans and shirt). They're quite a popular spot but don't really have a designated waiting area. The building houses the noodle bar on ground floor, the Milk Bar on the second, and they also have a nicer higher end restaurant upstairs which has elevator access.

Okay so I didn't really intend to go into so much detail with my thoughts on the actual restaurant. Now, more importantly, THE FOOD! I've been here a couple times now and each visit I was very impressed. Not only is the plating nice but the food on said plate is even better! On my visit a few weeks ago, the menu has changed slightly offering different types of Ramen dishes. I ended up getting their pumpkin Ramen, and I have to be honest, I never really ate or drank anything pumpkin (because I'm not basic haha) and don't really have much of an opinion on it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed it! It had coconut milk in the broth so it was nice and creamy. It had a delicate flavour, not overpowering. I wasn't a big fan of the hard chunks of pumpkin that was in it but of course it's only because I never really ate it. It was a very interesting twist on Ramen so I liked the variety. We also had the braised beef baos and oh man are they soft and fluffy. The meat just falls apart with every bite and is deliciously coated in a light sauce.

I wanted to weigh in with my opinion to see what all the fuss was about. 

VIBE 
If you want to leisurely wax on and wax off about life, this is not the place to do it. Starbucks should be on a nearby corner. These guys want you in and they want you out. Ka-ching! There are no coat hangers or even a hook underneath the bar (thanks for the heads up Yelpers) but I've realized it's probably due to the fact that they want you in and out more than it was a design oversight. 

And in-and-out I was. Literally, I was in and out in 20 minutes. To the T. No lineups (this was a Wednesday at 6:40 p.m. and the restaurant was pretty much to capacity). I didn't realize they were putting the hold-over upstairs. Smart. I was also told not to come here on a Friday night if you want quick service. That's just common sense. 

Staff weren't exactly the friendliest but they weren't UNfriendly. I guess they were just busy? They were quick and worked as a team. 

I ATE 
The pork buns. They were good. They weren't mind-blowing, orgiastic apparently as people are saying they are in New York (haven't been to the Chang empire in NYC so I don't know...). Again, they were a good snack and they came within 10-11 minutes.

For $10 and for the full meal at $18 with a coke, tax and tip, it's pricey. But again, you're not paying for the pork bun. You're paying for Momofuku's rent beside the Shangri-la. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I haven't had the noodles here. I probably won't (I'm not some die-hard noodle fan though). I know the prices are way cheaper in Chinatown or at Golden Turtle on Ossington. In fact, I'm going to go to Golden Turtle to compare the prices. And who knows how much the prices for ramen or pork buns in Vietnam are?! The blasphemy, right?!

Finally had the opportunity to go, and considering the mentioned ramen places that I've visited in the places (please see my other reviews), this was up in my alley.  And thus, I don't go into places with heightened expectations so that I can objectively judge the service, the cookery of the food in general.

Please keep in mind that even though I gave this review a 4 stars, I wanted to give in theory a 3.5 stars as I do think there are some improvements that the place could really benefit from to make themselves better.

Service:  It's great.  Simply put.  The employees are very pretty attentive from the time of coming in, to during the service.  I had a massive backpack on me and they graciously allowed me to stow my backpack in there little corner where they do their financial transactions (as you'll notice Momofuku comprises of benches and tables that don't accomodate for extra carry ons).  Coat racks are also at the front for your convenience to hang your coat.  I found the staff very nice and pretty informative of what appears to be a daily menu.  Some employees even gave out certain favourites and recommendations.

Food:  This is where I find a lot of the Toronto foodie nation have a split opinion and I can kind of see why.  For a place that is titled a ""Noodle Bar"", it doesn't hold up to the other ramen places that have made their way into Toronto.  I ordered the Momofuku ramen ($15) and while the ingredients are cooked very well, the dish as a whole lacks cohesion.  The soup base is tasty but has an aggressive saltiness to it which sadly dominates over the entirety of the dish, despite the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, the tender noodles and the fishcake in it.  The pork belly that was in it, was also too cooked to perfection, however, the soup base again, overwhelmed it. 

The pork buns were very delicious, a delicious bao that is paired with cucumbers, oysters and that pork was really delectable.  However the star of the show, were the pig tails which was SO DAMN BLEEPING GOOD.  These....literally fell off the bone and my brother and I literally devoured it.  It was in this fish sauce caramel that complimented so well with the pigtail and we literally raved about it to the waiter when he was collecting our dishes.  If you ever see this on the menu, it's a must try.

The dessert, which was a rice pudding, or whatever was available at the ""Milk"" bar were alright, although the pumpkin pie truffles that I got were good but horrendously rich (I know, I know...truffles are naturally rich) but I think I did myself no favours by having that after having several heavy dishes.

All in all, even though Momofuku has definite strengths in the delivery of their food, as a noodle bar, I feel they are slightly outclassed by the other contenders who simply put together a better all-around ramen product at a lower price.  I would strongly encourage that either Momofuku goes super inventive and create a ramen that deservedly can be priced higher or make the basic ramen phenomenal and price competitively with the other places.",2,0,0,positive

Atmosphere:

Its a cavernous two story space. Not cozy, open, airy and minimal, everything that the New York location isn't. I missed the low ceilings, narrow storefront and hussle and bustle. 

Service: 

Was great. Granted that I knew our server through friends. Service was friendly, prompt and informative. We ordered a dish on her recommendation and it was fantastic. People have complained about no coat racks and they now have them, they are drawers under stairs. Servers take your coat and store them for you.

Food: 

We ordered three 4 appetizers and ramen (there was three of us). Way too much food. Up first was the Rice Cakes ($11), basically like gnocchi made of super sticky rice in a sweet & spicy sauce with sesame seeds and scallions. Really good. Up next was a sweetbreads dish ($13) (special for the night). Super tasty, they were not battered and fried. On a bed of rice with some sort of sauce (sorry, I can't remember the details). Pork Buns ($9) were also ordered, pretty close to NYC though the pork wasn't hot enough. Kimchi ($6)  although really good, skip it, its a huge portion, we didn't even get through have of it. 

Ramen: 

We all went with the classic Momofuku Ramen ($16). Noodles were a bit overdone and a bit mushy. Egg was perfectly cooked. Shredded pork shoulder was delicious, pork belly was good but had a huge amount of fat on it. The major letdown was the broth. It was not the same as New York. Missing was the smokiness to the broth. It was overly salty, kind of sweet and really didn't stand out from any of the other great Ramen shops in Toronto (I prefer Guu Kiton's broth). 

Overall:

It was good. I think the concept of opening all three restaurants in one space was a mistake. From a management perspective it makes total sense. But fundamentally the Momofuku experience is completely lost in the Toronto space. They don't seem to be reaching the same clientele as in New York as well. The restaurant was full of Bay Street Bankers and financial district workers, whereas in NY, its a very young, Soho\/East Village crowd.

Momofuku pork belly buns: served with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber. The pork was juicy and delicious, with generous portion size. The scallion and cucumber added a refreshing and fresh crunch to the dish. The hoisin sauce gave it a touch of sweet flavor. 

Soft serve cereal milk flavor with cornflakes: Omg! So brilliant! The flavor of the soft serve was phenomenal, and reminded me of Horlick drink, which I am totally addicted to. And add the corn flake topping? Yes please! A super fun dessert to eat that imitated cereal and milk breakfast. Loved this. 

Oh yes. Then we visited the Milk Bar upstairs for a galore of baked goods. So many yummy cookies. And the crack pie was melt-in-my-mouth to die for. So good.

Service was prompt and friendly. The environment was friendly. Atmosphere was clean and modern. 

Overall, I am in love. I wish they would open a location in Seattle so I could get some Momofuku goodies more often. Xoxo:)",5,4,5,positive

So, I told the greeter to split the group to 4 and 3. He told me it would still be 2 hours wait. I felt bad inviting my friend who has a 3.5 y.o. kid to this place. Luckily my friend brought snacks for her kid.

After close to 2 hours wait, we were seated around 8:30pm. We ordered and within 10 mins we got our food.

Here's what we tried:
- Momofuku ramen
* If you tried a semiautomatic Japanese ramen before, don't even bother with this. The broth \/ soup is bland and the noodles quite chewy. None of the ingredients blend well, especially the pickled cabbage. The pork was alright. The highlight is the onsen egg.
* The bowl is huge but soup + noodles only reaches half of the bowl's level. For a $14 ramen, IMO it's a bit overpriced

- Pork Bun
* If you've been to NYC Ippudo, theirs are way better.

- Rice cake
* Typical Korean dish, spicy rice cake. Nothing special.

- Smoked chicken wings
* Flavourful and has a kick to it
* The best dish among everything we tried

I give one star ONLY because of the chicken wings. Other than that, I'm left with an unsatisfied stomach.

All in all, Momofuku ... you can fool me once but you won't fool me twice. Won't return ever.",6,1,0,positive

Ramen starting at 14 bucks? it's average size, the noodle are soft and not chewy like how ramen should be. the momofuku ramen, has 2 small pieces or pork belly. The soup was SALTY!!!! and it was nothing special. How can you call yourself a ""NOODLE"" bar when the noodles are nothing good. There are a lot of excellent Ramen in downtown Toronto, please do not waste any time\/money here.

We also ordered the pork, shrimp, chicken, and reuben buns, I know that's a lot of buns 

The pork bun, was blend!!!! and cold.
shrimp bun, was like a shrimp paste patty, where's the shrimp?
reuben bun, was like sliced meat that I get at a supermarket, inside a bun. I can make a better sandwich myself, no thanks.
chicken bun, it looked like the shrimp bun, where it was a patty (maybe they gave us the wrong thing, either way, we did not eat this one cause it came AFTER we got our bill, we paid for it anyways, got it to go, only to throw it in the garbage, cause the food here is THAT bad) they forced is to take the chicken buns cause it was already ordered, even after we said we did not want it anymore and we were done eating.

We also ""heard"" about the rice cakes, but we got the Daiso version, so review on the rice cakes over there. Daiso food was even WORST than noodle bar.

I am definitely wondering who the clientele for Momofuku is, and how savvy palates are for those who frequent downtown.  I think this restaurant would be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates modern urban architecture, and palates that are fairly developed in experiencing Japanese and contemporary Asian cuisine.  There are reviews that compare it with other Asian and ramen houses, and if that's all you are looking for, then that's fine.  However, it's not what David Chang is aiming for, and so expectations should be adjusted.

Chang has serious cred in that he worked his way up the restaurant scene in NYC, and dropped everything to be a noodle and ramen understudy in Japan, as noodles are his passion.  These were authentic restaurants that only did one type of food, as many are in Japan.  When he came back to NYC, he opened up Momofuku (named after the great Momofuku Ando who invented instant ramen and thus started a revolution), and his goal wasn't to create simply classic ramen but to put his own spin on it that would start the next generation of noodle making.  Most people who are following these food trends would agree that he is at the forefront of that new wave.  

So, I am a diehard fan of traditional ramen--although it's hard to say what is traditional because there are numerous varieties depending on what locale they originated in, such as sapporo ramen, shoyu, tonkotsu, tsukemen, and so forth.  It would thus be really difficult to compare Momofuku's ramen with other ramen shops in the area unless you are comparing specific ramen dishes.  Tonkotsu, for example, is a heavy, meaty broth that some people love and others don't like--perhaps preferring a lighter, cleaner variety such as miso.  

Momofuku has a classic ramen which includes some very expensively source ingredients, and it is in part why his food costs more--for example his pork comes from what is considered the best stock in all of North America.  I should clarify I know that is certain for his NYC restaurant, for this one here I did not ask.  The work that's involved for something as simple as say the poached egg, is extensive, and I would bet without visiting them all that his poached egg is the best in the city as far as comparisons would go.  It was remarkable.  

Ramen really has two major parts--the noodles and the stock.  I already mentioned his stock is made from the best meat, and as far as the noodles, I can also comment that Sun Noodle in the States is the best noodle making company in the western world.  You should know that ramen noodles are best made by machine and not by hand, as counterintuitive as that may seem.  Much of that has to do with the need for the ramen noodles to be as springy and textured as possible, which keeps it from getting soft in the broth and also creates the most surface area to allow the broth to cling to it, giving it its flavor.  I'm doubtful that the other ramen houses source from the same place, but I can assure you that serious noodles lovers like me care most about the noodle more than anything else.  That alone makes Momofuku worth visiting.

What I appreciate about the dishes at Momofuku is that they truly do pay homage to the great ramen and noodle tradition, but Chang is not solely set on authenticity.  He takes it to another level, which allows me to slowly evolve my palate to new experiences that work.  Frankly, they are doing this in Japan, too.  Tsukemen, for example, is a new kind of ramen that is mind blowing--eaten in the style of mori soba with intense flavor that packs a wallop.

This is all not to say that you will love Momofuku, but I think it's worth giving a try if you are a serious foodie.  I would encourage you to indeed compare it to other Asian noodle houses and ramen spots, but to compare it with the right context that might help you appreciate the various nuances in Asian cuisine.  Then you, too, might discover what aspects of ramen and noodles you particularly like, which will let you be an informed customer and a happier one since you will be able to choose the proprietors and businesses that most suit what you are after.

Regarding my four star rating, it actually has to do with the Japanese yam side I had.  The ramen is five stars, but the yam, while delicious, had slightly undercooked elements in the center of it (easy mistake to make by line staff), and something David Chang might have fired them over in the early and more tempestuous days of his fascinating career.  He certainly would expect better, that's for sure.  So, it is to encourage the fact that there certainly is room for improvement.

Happy eating to all of you!",6,0,1,positive

Momofuku Noodle Bar is sleek, simplistic, and modern with communal tables. I'm a fan of their beautiful decor but personally, I am not a fan of dining at communal tables. 

Food: 
The Momofuku Ramen($14) looks good but tastes meh. The ramen was pretty bland & lukewarm and the noodles could have been firmer. Tip: add hot sauce if you want more flavour. I also tried the Kimchi Stew($16) - a.k.a Kimchi Chiggae - and I was quite disappointed with this as David Chang is Korean. Kimchi Stew comes with rice cake, pork, some veggies and obviously Kimchi, accompanied with rice. I thought that the stew lacked that rich flavour but it was better than the Ramen. The Pork Buns ($10 for 2) were succulent and flavourful. If you're going to check this place out, TRY this. They also have Chicken Buns and Shiitake Buns if you don't want pork. 

Service is fast - I noticed that people usually got their orders within 10-15 minutes. 

I understand that Momofuku in Toronto just opened but they should really get a coat racks \/hooks soon. I asked the server if I can hang my jacket somewhere (yes, it was chilly in September) and he said ""Umm.. you can put it on the floor."" The server wasn't rude or anything but really?

* Corn
* Momofuku Ramen 
* Extremely Spicy Noodle 
* Spicy Lamb Bun
* Cereal Milk Soft Serve 

My friend had ""one"" wing as her appetizer, she mentioned it had good flavours and enjoyable. I had the corn which literally was a corn on the cob with seasoning and lime\/butter on the side. It was nothing special. 

Spicy Lamb Bun, this didn't taste like lamb to be fair it looked like spam. It was meh and something you could pass up on. 

Out of all the ramen options, the only one that had soup was the Momofuku Ramen so I ordered that one and my friend ordered the Extremely Spicy Noodles. The Momofuku was ""ok"" and had good flavour but it wasn't that amazing. I've had better to be honest. The pork belly and shoulder was slightly dry. The Extremely Spicy Noodles had no soup base and resembled spaghetti? My friend said it was spicy but no flavour beyond the taste of chili. It was disappointing. 

Cereal Milk Soft Serve! I have heard about this and was interested as to what it would taste like. It had corn flakes flavour with vanilla ice cream. It was decent but again not amazing.

Bao - these are excellent. The buns are soft, and have delicate flavours on each - savoury pork, sweet mushroom, and crunchy fried chicken.

Noodles - my favourite is the chilled spicy noodle, which mixes the spicy flavours in with sweet crunchy cashews. I would also recommend the Dan Dan Mein. One of my dining companions had the ramen which I enjoyed too, but I would say go for the noodle dishes.

Dessert - how often have you slurped cereal milk after breakfast and wished they would turn it into soft-serve? Well, the cereal milk flavoured ice cream is awesome and definitely add the cereal flakes.  There is also a coffee (double double) option that look forward trying.

Ambiance:  The service was friendly and knowledgable; the dbe warned that it is communal seating but it doesn't even factor into the experience in a negative way any more than it would at, say, at a certain famous deli in Montreal.

First off, a restaurant known to be a noodle bar, the noodles were not good at all. I was super disappointed about this. These two other guys sitting next to us had asked us how we had felt about the noodles and told them our honest opinion; they too were disapppointed and confused as to what the hype was about. The deserts were okay; they were better than the noodles. I will not be rec others to come out here to try this. I am from NY and I would rec sticking with NYC's noodle bars.",2,0,0,positive

The offering at that time was a bun, noodle bowl and dessert for $18.

I opted for the Pork Bun (with hoisin, scallion and cucumber), the Momofuku Ramen (with pork belly and shoulder, fish cake, egg), and for dessert the Coffee Crisp Panna Cotta.

My husband went for the BBQ Pork Bun (with mayo, slaw and sweet pickle), Momofuku Ramen and the Cereal Milk Soft Serve.

The buns were awesome and flavourful, though I could see how people might complain about the regular price as they weren't huge (though standard bun size I'd say).

I loved the ramen! There was a depth of flavour to the broth and garnishes and the pork was amazingly tender. The portion size was just right for me, though I could see how people who are accustomed to mammoth ramen bowls might be disappointed (though how often do they actually finish those mammoth bowls?).

Also a winner was the panna cotta. Sooo good. Perfect consistency, great flavour and much larger portion than necessary (but I didn't mind ;)). The cereal milk soft serve was alright...not my thing methinks.

My only major complain would be the price of drinks... Everything was a few dollars more than you'd pay elsewhere. Wine for example was $10-$13 for a 4 oz glass.

Service was polite and helpful. Interior was gorgeous, though loud.

For the parents out there, I did note that they have a stack of highchairs available.

The name of this restaurant was no where to be found which made it even harder to find. It was like Where's Waldo but in this case, Where's Momofuku?!

The decor of this place was very sleek and modern with an open kitchen located at the back of the restaurant. The front doors were heavy as heck, man! Even a muscle head would have trouble pulling it open...exaggerations aside, they were actually quite heavy. The service here was great and very attentive. There is a second level floor to this establishment as well and it's where their Milk Bar is located but that'll be a separate review.

The menu was very small and had a limited number of items on it. I've heard that this place is popular for their baos but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try them but we did end up ordering their ramen. We ordered two Momofuku ramens and the Dan Dan mein.

The Dan Dan Mein was ok but the Momofuku ramen was meh.

It was a let down and you can definitely get better tasting ramen at a cheaper price elsewhere (Sansotei and Santouka). It's hyped up and I can clearly see why it is. The decor and the atmosphere of this place makes it seem very upscale and cool but if the food isn't great, then what's the point? I'll have to give this place another try with their baos because their ramen disappointed me.

But the rest of the meal was delicious and it's one of the cheaper lunch menus for Winterlicious.

I thought my dish lacked flavour somewhat in the broth, while the pork was done just right.  Must've been steamed\/roasted or whatever it is that they do at Momofuku to their pork for hours.  The seasoning seeped in and I was never so delighted to eat two chunks of pure fat.  This was by far better than the chicken in Winter Ramen, which tasted like teriyaki chicken with borderlined dryness - ultimate nono for this kind of protein-_-

The highlight of the ramen, though, was the noodles themselves.  The wheat noodles were cooked with a texture that couldn't be more perfect.  It was the right amount of chewy, and I think the lack of oil in the broth actually contributed to just how great the noodles tasted.  

In addition to that, we also got the pork belly buns.  It was the same kind of pork in my ramen, but slathered with hoisin sauce and lettuce.  The simple combination was surprisingly delicious, because their pork is done just right.  The spicy chicken sando we got, however, tasted like KFC's big crunch (which is abs. delicious of course).  Momofuku cheated.. charging us twice the price for the same KFC sandwich and replaced the buns with an extra doughy dough.  Fine Momofuku, you still win.. 'cause I like my Colonel Sanders dupe

The decor was interesting - three floors, first being the noodle bar, second with the little cold cellar of milk bar, and the top being daisho.  I liked the open concept with the long tables, but a reservation on a weekday night didn't seem to be needed as there were quite a few empty spots when we somehow got shafted to the side noodle bar facing the wall.  Switched to a table with actual leg space after, ofc, but I don't know if I'd come back again just because I've tried all that I wanted to and they didn't leave me wanting more.

The description says that it has pork sausage, spinach, cashews, and black bean. Oddly enough, the spinach was raw. I'm not sure why that was, but raw spinach on noodles is a strange texture contrast and an awkward mouthful. The black bean sauce was super salty. Preserved black beans are super salty to begin with.

Tried the Momofuku ramen for $15.  The broth was really unremarkable.  They threw in some kimchi which was not innovative, but tasted like some last ditch attempt my husband might take to make instant ramen more palatable at home.  I was also a little frustrated with the egg situation.  Runny undercooked eggs are a no no in pregnancy so I asked the the egg be cooked thoroughly. The waitress refused and said, no I can either eat the egg runny or not have the egg at all in the ramen but they wouldn't overcook it for me. So I ordered it without the egg.........LAME. 

We tried a variety of the other dishes including the rice cakes, Japanese yam,  shitake buns, shrimp buns (highly recommended by the waitress) and the fried chicken wings.  The rice cakes were nice, chewy with a delightful little crunch. The fried chicken was good but then again its difficult to go wrong with fried chicken.  The shitake buns were okay, nothing to rave about.  The shrimp buns were terrible.  The bun that I got had an essence of bleach taste to it and the shrimp tasted very processed and hotdog like. The Japanese yam was nothing to rave about, it taste more like a pancake with mayonnaise drizzled on top. 

Overall, I cannot understand for the life of me what all the buzz is about this place.  The ramen is nothing special and the majority of the side dishes are really average to subaverage.  After this experience I have no intention of wasting my time, money or meals on any of the other Momofuku chains.  

The service was overall okay in terms of efficiency, but they were a little snooty, particularly our waitress.  If only I knew her name I'd give her a proper shot out, but that's okay, I'm just passing through and never will return again.

I've also heard Toronto thinks it s the centre of the universe ( as does New York) so of course it's going to be big and bold, even for ramen! As Wikipedia states, it wasn't an accident that Chef Chang named his restaurants not only after the inventor of instant ramen, but also because the name in English is similar to ""motherfucker"" - Kudos Chef. 

The place is very busy! They take reservations, but being solo in the 6ix I opted to stroll over and walk in, their host suggested the second floor and called up to the bar, to ensure I'd have a seat at Nikai. 
It's loud, chaotic and filled with great energy. You are served by whoever seems to be walking by, the atmosphere is inviting and energetic, lots of couples, tables of friends laughing and sharing big bowls of noodles and ramen. The first floor has long tables, the second floor has sofas and comfy chairs while you wait for your table or the bar.
The bartender made fantastic cocktails, East of Eden (toasted bourbon, sake & lemon) was perfectly served in a classic stemmed cocktail glass. The bartender looks after the room, so don't be in a hurry for a drink or arrive thirsty. I'm not sure he actually likes people but he certainly loves the art of making a cocktail. I was dying to ask him to pull his pants up, alas, I had an evening of ass crack and noodles. I started with pickled vegetables, a bit much for one and too much celery, the couple beside me ordered kimchi, had a couple bites and left it, the appetizers seem more like they should be smaller portion add ons to the ramen and noodles, as it seemed a shame everyone (myself included) was smothering their dishes in sriracha to bring out flavour.

Luckily, we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving at one of the quieter corners of the restaurant.  Browsing the menu, I was settled on the okonomiyaki and the momofuku ramen.

Okonomiyaki arrived in a fair amount of time even with a full house.  It had a crispy base and topped with lots of toppings that served to cover the generous drizzle of mayo underneath.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.

The momofuku ramen's broth was good but nothing to write home about.  The noodles, on the other hand, were excellent and cooked el dente.  The bowl was topped with a few slices of fish cake, napa cabbage, pork belly & shoulder, nori seaweed, and a soft-boiled egg.  I really enjoyed their version of the soft-boiled egg as the egg white was just cooked and almost just floating in the broth to protect the yolk.  Yummm. :)

We asked if we could get the large format, and the waitress informed us that they require 24 hours advanced notice for the meal, but will check with the kitchen. I don't remember seeing this requirement on their website, but was not going to be too disappointed if things didn't work out because there were still the bao's to try. However, she returned and told us that they just happened to have a set available because a party had cancelled their order, so we could take it. And so we did.

Before the chicken came, some equipment was brought to the table: a large bowl for the bones; two smaller bowls; two tongs to grab the chicken; 8 scallion pancakes; a small bowl of ginger scallion sauce; a small bowl of jalapeno garlic sauce; a jar of pickled vegetables; a basket of lettuce, herbs, and radishes; and tabasco salt.

We finished the jar of pickled vegetables rather quickly as there wasn't much, and was wondering if they were complimentary. We asked a waiter passing by, and he said he had to check with the kitchen. Nope, apparently each jar was $6. Guess that was it for pickled vegetables. Fortunately, they were OK with providing extra lettuce.

The chicken came within 15 minutes, and it was a pretty large plate for 4 to 8 people........ I guess? Maybe if you're with a party of light-eaters, where a thigh and a drumstick is enough to fill you up.

It comes as advertised: a bunch of southern fried chicken and a bunch of korean fried chicken. You're looking at roughly 12 pieces of each, but that number includes small wings\/drumsticks. There are probably only 6 large pieces of each flavor. On average, between the four of us, we only had about 4-5 pieces each, plus some of those small pieces.

The southern fried chicken was juicy, skin was crispy, and the flavor was great. The korean friend chicken was not too spicy, not too sweet. Mixed with the sauces, the lettuce, or the scallion panackes, it provides a great dining experience.

However, this is $125 for fried chicken. I am not a fried chicken connoisseur, and was unable to tell the difference between the Popeyes fried chicken straight out of the fryer I had last week, and this momofuku fried chicken. For perspective, you can get 16 pieces of chicken at popeyes for $30, and I'm pretty conflicted. Same for korean fried chicken: there are so many korean fried chicken places uptown and in koreatown on bloor that offer you just as much chicken for $30.

Granted, the dining experience you get at the places I mentioned above, are very different from how momofuku presents themselves. It's a clean restaurant with interesting decor, all the way to the washrooms and the elevator, and there are plenty of other options to choose from the menu on top of the chicken. Your waiter checks up on you and offers water refills, which you definitely won't find at popeyes.

But realistically, unless you have business clients over or you're taking your date out for some fried chicken and need somewhere nice, I'd just stop by a place that specializes in fried chicken. Bring your own lettuce, dips, and\/or scallion pancakes.",9,4,4,negative

Got here at 6 PM on a Saturday night. It's Saturday ... and maybe a lot of kids are fuelling up for Nuit Blanche ... the poor girl huddling at the front in her hoodie told me 30-40 minutes for three. No problem. She did not mention that once we are texted, we have 10 minutes to get there, but thanks to Yelp (sparkle wink!), we were fine. We waited in the hotel lounge, where we rebuffed drinks.

Ended up waiting closer to 60. I admit that if I weren't already primed for such a wait, I'd be pissed. When I went to check on our reservation at the 50-minute mark, the group of three ahead of me was told the legendary TWO HOURS. Why? 

So we were seated at seven. In the only major service blip of the evening, within 5-10 minutes of being seated, we were approached three times by three different servers on whether we were ready to order. They were super busy and I'd rather such a place err on overattentiveness instead of accidentally ignoring us, but it got a little silly with the third server.  It's not a long menu at all, but since we wanted to split and share, we needed a little time to chat and co-ordinate.

Specials of the night included hangar steak and pork belly congee. Ok ... Toronto ... unless you're sick or dying, don't order congee at any time except breakfast. Rice porridge for dinner is sad.

We ordered pork and chicken buns. Delish and more fatty than Ippudo's, but I really like fat, so maybe your mileage will vary. Our little dishes for eating were warmed. They also gave us a knife for cutting the buns without asking, which was a nice touch. Do I disagree that you can get similar bao at Banh Mi Boys for less? Nope. But you're here, aren't you? Might as well.

Two of us got white wine served in a tumbler ... weird. I appreciate stemware may be too flimsy and breakable, but I just don't like white served in anything that I clutch in my warm paw. 

Ramen -- I am not an expert, so I can't comment on ""authenticity."" I found it tasty, though a little unusual. Poached egg instead of boiled with the soft centre. I love, love poached eggs in most cases, but when I have ramen, I want the heavenly half-boiled egg. I don't think the bowl was served very hot. It comes with kimchi (?) -- something pickled. This apparently pisses some people off, but I like pickled veggies in general, so I was happy. There didn't seem to be a lot of soup, which was ... weird. Big portion -- lots to eat. 

Also: Why no Japanese ladle? Dinky Chinese spoon is no good for big bowls. Luckily, it fell in after I had already finished.

My friend had the chilled ramen, which she reported enjoying. Spicy. 

The table next to us ordered chicken wings. They looked good, but far, far from $12 good. My dad makes FANTASTIC Hong Kong-style wings; I told him he should charge $12 and he snorted.

Atmosphere? Very loud. We got seated at a communal table, and the stools were sturdy and not awkward. We were also lucky to be seated in a corner next to a window (and column), so we had light and a view, and less traffic. But the lack of a place to put your coat is something for $5\/bowl places, not $16. 

Everything came quickly, though not too fast. The chilled ramen came a little later (maybe five minutes or less) than the two ramen bowls. 

Aside from the one aforementioned blip, all the service was quick and nice. Everything was cleared away efficiently, but I didn't feel rushed. Our bill, pre-tip, was $91. Two bun orders, two ramen, one cold ramen, two white wines. Not SO insane, but ... a little bit.

I ordered the ramen ($15) and while I found the noodles bland at first, I actually ended up really liking the ramen because I could eat the whole bowl, including drinking all the broth (don't judge me!), without it tasting too salty.  I really liked the addition of kimchi into the ramen, which you can order an entire jar of for $7 as a side dish. So while it wasn't super traditional Japanese ramen as far as I can tell, it was a really good interpretation of it.

We order the buns - we went with the rueben bun but I think we should have tried the pork or veggie instead.  The Rueben was slathered in sauce and was too tart for my liking.  I love the bun though, it was super soft.  I could have eaten the bun plain.

Next noodles! I ordered the smoked chicken ramen and my friend ordered the momofuku ramen bowl.  When our bowls arrived, they were nicely presented.  Our waitress even brought us extra bowls to share.  I really like the noodles and the crispy chicken skin in my bowl.  The flavour of the broth was interesting but not overtly salted.

My first review gave the place 3 stars and I had expressed a great dissatisfaction with the contrast between the quality of the food and the price being paid for it. I had concluded by saying that while the food is pretty good here, there are better and cheaper alternatives.

After writing the review, I was invited to return again in order to spend some time speaking with one of the managers and to be offered a few items off the menu that are being developed for their updated menu which is likely now updated.

To start, I had a great time speaking with and getting to know the manager who invited me back. It is clear that he has a passion for his workplace and I truly appreciated his desire to invite me back and speak to their choices of ingredients and menu\/food design. I developed a heightened appreciation for the team behind the restaurant itself.

My wife and I were then presented with a number of dishes to eat and enjoy a fine dinner on the house.

Here is where I find myself conflicted. I cannot in good conscience improve my rating of the place because the food was actually worse than I had experienced in the past. This is not to say that the food is terrible here, it's just that the restaurant world is highly competitive and in order to receive rave reviews, the food should provide some kind of wow factor or at least be a solid and pleasing experience.

Our meal began with a starter of Onigiri followed by an off-menu order of Okonomiyaki. Our server explained that the Okonomiyaki here was exactly like her favourite Okonomiyaki back in Japan where she was born. The Onigiri was actually pretty nice but we both found the Okonomiyaki to be far too mushy. Further, the sauces that topped the pancake bottom were an overwhelming mixture of salty, sour, and umami; ultimately masking whatever subtle flavour the rest of the dish had. We were informed that the dish included Kimchi but it was impossible to detect any kimchi at all...

Finally, we shared their signature fried chicken with caviar Don. This place has become famous for their fried chicken and caviar which is surely an innovative combination, but not out of this world amazing. My wife and I both agreed that this dish was probably the best we had, but at its price point, the wow factor isn't there.

We debated if Momofuku's rating should go up and in the end, I simply cannot give it more than the original 3 that I gave it before. Food is competitive and you really need to know what the competition is doing to learn how to beat them.

After we left and went for a walk, this experience lead me to come up with an idea for Restauranteurs. I believe that owners or head chefs should encourage their staff to always go and eat at other places that serve similar food in order to know if your products stand up against the competition or not. Also, by learning what others are doing, you will gain inspiration on how to go beyond the norms and offer a truly stand out meal to your customers!",3,2,2,positive

Came here for a birthday event and the server was less then welcoming. She went through standard greetings, but the tone felt condescending like I didn't belong. After being shown to a shared table we started looking at the menu. Now being a noodle bar, several of the friends wanted to try the noodles. Not being the biggest fan of that particular type I opted for the something else.

The noodles arrived in a stylish bowl that made it look like it had depth. Now presentation wise I felt it looked quite nice, but that is only to mask its underlying deception of the taste. It was bland and lacked any kind of unique flavor, the texture of the noodles were average and nothing stood out. Were they hand pulled? I don't expect every restaurant to blow my mind, but meet my somewhat low expectations if possible. The portion size was also small that would not leave an average person full and not even the girls were satisfied with the portion size and taste. 

Now I didn't notice until near the end, but our server was only present at the beginning and end. None of that checking in while my face is full of food, I don't particular enjoy that encounter, but I appreciate the gesture. At the end of the night we were so unsatisfied we went to a nearby korean restaurant to get a second dinner.

So, why a 2 star rating when everything disappointed me besides the decor? The company and stories that we shared after. Just goes to show that having a good group of people to eat with can make any restaurant experience seem bearable...so thank you Momofuku for giving me the experience of having a second dinner.",0,1,0,positive

When, I see something that's only 3 stars, I tend to stay away.  However, in this case, I decided to buck the trend and come here.  Partly because I wanted to get something from Milkbar upstairs.  But, more on that one later and in another review.

We stayed at Delta Toronto which, walking with kids, seemed like 18 miles!  But, it was only about 1\/2 a mile, really.  We went on a Thursday night and while we normally need reservations, we were able to get a table since we came early enough.

We got the Momofuku Ramen, Sichuan Noodle, Chicken Ramen, Pork Bao, and Chicken Bao.  The Momofuku Ramen was my favorite.  It had a sauce in the middle that was spicy (not too spicy), but the flavor was on point.  The Sichuan Noodle was really good, too, but not exactly a filling meal.  Also, it wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for, but then again, they had another dish that was called the Extremely Spicy Noodle.  The Baos were equally delicious.  My favorite was the Pork, while the wife liked the Chicken one better.  

Now, something a little different, if you want dessert.  You can either order a milk and cereal soft serve, or you can get some desserts up the stairs to the Momofuku Milkbar (which is more like a refrigerator) and bring some down to your table.  You can pay for your dessert downstairs.  The soft serve was good.  It had the texture of ice cream, but the flavor of actual milk and cereal.  Meaning, it wasn't overly sweet.",41,32,37,positive

Started off with a very tasty pork bao. Then we all got the Smoked Chicken Ramen (although I was torn between that and the Dan Dan Mein).  The ramen was really good, with the noodles al dente - and lots of fun goodies inside like a perfect poached egg, crispy chicken skin and the chicken. The broth was sweet and savoury without getting too salty. I wasn't thirsty afterwards, and actually wanted to drink this entire soup. 

For dessert, there was a rice pudding and a chocolate pudding. Both excellent, but just a bit too rich for my stomach. 

Service was good, and a great vibe in the communal restaurant. Reservations were easily made online, and they were really good about letting us still sit about 30 mins after our scheduled time, since our entire party wasn't there yet. 

Love the bright windows and natural light, it was a great place to have a meal - and we weren't rushed to get up and leave. It's a bit pricey, but you're in the heart of downtown, inside a posh hotel and eating a brand name (basically). Normally ramen is $14-15 and not any bigger size than what you'd get at other places. 

Just a note, I was shocked that the family beside us did not eat their Jar of Kimchi (their starter) and give the whole thing untouched back to the waitress as their desserts arrived! Give it to me!

All the Momofuku Toronto eateries are housed in a swanky downtown glass cubic building attached to the Shangri-la hotel. The noodle bar is on the ground floor; the grand contemporary interior design decked out in wood in intricate rectangular geometric patterns, and lined with communal tables and bar seating. It feels snooty just being in there. Service was attentive and unintrusive to say the least.

I remember having the signature Momofuku ramen. I recall it was simply okay but not remarkable as I thought it would be for a place like this-certainly not for the small portion and big price tag ($14). Granted, they are also known for their own spins on ramen and other Asian noodle comforts on a constantly-changing, yet very limited menu.

I was chastised by fellow friends for failing to try their famous pork bun. Apparently they are so good they are really stand out as the true signature product of this culinary brand. I would not mind coming back someday for that, but Momofuku overall only impressed me as a come-once-for-the-experience-of-being-here type of place.

It was much more sour-tasting than I had expected, and I was very disappointed with the extra 0.75 cents I paid to have as little as 3 corn flakes crushed on top. I didn't finish the bowl.

Noodles are arranged on the menu in order from the most to least broth. Starts with the house noodle, the momofuku ramen. Then there are usually 5 more noodles, including a seasonal one. One is the Ginger Scallion Noodle, vegetarian, which is noteworthy for ramen where all broths are usually made with meat! This one is the last one, as it has no broth, but delicious all the same. Slightly oily at the bottom,  but the cucumber and pickled cabbage keep the dish refreshing. Another noteworthy ramen is the Extremely Spicy. They aren't kidding around here. Servers always warn that it cannot be returned to the kitchen.  I've seen people sweat and cry over this one. Served with a small glass of soy milk (the delicious asian kind), its totally worth it if you can handle the spice. 

Must try: Pork Belly Steamed Bao. Best bao in the city. Pork cooked to perfection, bao so delicate and tasty. Saucy and refreshing. (Other bao option is shiitake mushroom, good, but it ain't no pork belly bao)

A good selection of other small items available too, always worth trying!

You can order slushy (and non) drinks or beers\/wine with your meal, which I find clashy with the noodles in the best way possible!

Maybe all the hype got my expectations way too high, I don't know, but what I do know is that despite the fact that I didn't fall in love with the ramen, I'll probably go back... and I'll probably order ramen. & pork buns!
I will also go back because they have Milkbar right upstairs for those of us that are always craving for something sweet. Sometimes I only go for the Milkbar goodies.

If you're like me and watch food TV regularly you know why we HAD to visit Momofuku during our short stay in T.O.

In town for the annual Art Toronto art fair myself, my wife, her father and his girlfriend were excited to try David Chang's famous noodles. This my introduction of David Chang, and really the whole ramen noodle concept to the others (exception being my wife) and I was eagerly anticipating this visit and not quite sure what to expect.

We arrived just after 1pm knowing the place could be busy and we had other things to do earlier in the day. My immediate impression was that the main restaurant was going to be way larger than it was. Long tables and benches were provided for seating and there was an air of excitement that filled the joint. We immediately were greeted by our knowledgeable server and off we went to get schooled in the ""world of Chang.""

After staring at the menu and catching glimpses of other dishes zooming past, we each decided on something: 2 Ramens and 2 noodle dishes + Beers.

Our meals came in good time and we all devoured. The bowls each shifted around the table as each were excited to try the different tastes and infusions. Smiles all around.

When chatting with locals we soon found out that Momofuku is NOT the best Ramen place in town. I wasn't surprised. There is way more to this spot than the Ramen and I look forward to more visits when I can try other dishes. 

Note: make your way upstairs to Momofuku Milk Bar where tasty treats await. I picked up a t-shirt to commemorate the visit and almost purchased a cookbook and magazine, but will wait to see prices online ;)",0,0,0,positive

After much hype and anticipation, the day Toronto foodies has been waiting for has arrived: Momofuku is here in our own city!! Brap brap!! 

Inside the new Shangri-La hotel, Momofuku will have 3 restos. The first one to open (today!) is the noodle bar. The interior is packed to fit as many people as possible, and the service is swift. I suspect they are gonna do very well here. There are blond wood communal tables and seats lining the windows and walls. The design is simple and clean, like the NYC locations we have come to know and love. 

The menu right now is small. We tried the momofuku ramen -- nice, delicately flavoured broth and melt-in-your-mouth tender pulled pork and sliced pork belly. The egg was also gooey and yolky in the centre. Yummy!! The ramen was good, but not as 'springy' as I like it. We also got the pork belly buns - obviously! They did not disappoint. Fluffy white bun, tangy sauce, and delicious, succulent pork done just right. For drinks - it's simple, just a few wines, beers, and sakes.",6,1,1,positive

We ordered everything from the Summerlicious tasting menu and it was all phenomenal. Dan Dan spicy pork ramen was yummo, as well as the potato and chive--very nice broths and perfect noodles. The clear noodle winner was the ginger and scallion. Mind blowing. Fresh, packed with flavor and unlike any ramen I'd ever tried.

The noodles we had after however, we're a bit of a let down. My wife got the chilled spicy noodles. They tasted similar to the northern Chinese style noodles you get at dumpling houses, but they used ramen noodles instead. It was a little overly salty, but this style of sauce tends to be that way.  I ordered the momofuku ramen and was really disappointed that the portion was much smaller than the cold noodles considering that it also costed more.  Overall, there was nothing really wrong with the ramen.  It tasted fine, was seasoned well, and the noodles were a good texture.  It just wasn't anything special.

At the risk of sounding repetitive, I am going to agree with most of the other Yelp reviewers for this restaurant in that it is okay but not anything special.  

The decor of the building is probably a 'wow' factor for the patrons, since the restaurant is housed in a glass building, or at least, the entire wall facing University Ave. is glass.  This means no matter what floor of this restaurant you are on, you'll be able to get a good view of outside and a lot of light.  In a city where most ramen places are tiny and often dark on the inside, Momofuku definitely outshines them in this aspect.

It was quite busy when we went in for a late lunch so the restaurant was packed. We were seated in one of the bar tables that faced a mirror on the wall, which I believe would work better for a solitary diner, not for a couple. Understanding that it was busy and they were very lacking of avaliable tables, we seated ourselves on the awkward, uncomfortable bar stools.  We saw our waitress 3 times: taking our order, bringing our order, and when paying the bill.  

As we came here for lunch, my bf and I both ordered the Momofuku ramen - figured that if the name is on it, it should be a tasty house-special type of ramen. Meh, it tasted fine but not spectacular.  The pork was not as tender and juicy as I am used to getting from other ramen shops and the overall portion was a little underwhelming. The soup was not amazingly tasty either.  I have had much better ramen in same said dark, small ramen places in Toronto.  It was a little disappointing that the ramen did not match this restaurant's attractive and expansive decor.

Momofuku is one of these bad sequels riding on the fame of its predecessor, banking on the name to bolster it's ROI. Now, I haven't been to the famed Momofuku in NYC but have a trusted circle of foodie friends who have and have reported back on its deliciousness.  So, when I heard there was a location in Toronto, it was at the top of my list to try when I was in town. Since I haven't tried the original, I had to compare what I had to similar items in the Toronto area. for reference, the baos were compared to one's at Banh  Mi Boys and the ramen to Santouka. To start, the baos were just Ok. The bun was fresh and good but the pork inside lacked distinct flavoring. It was in all sense of the description simply a steamed bun with a piece of pork and sliver of scallion stuffed inside. The ramen again was good but not standout. On the salty side, the flavor was just not there and lacked the depth I was looking for. Finally we tried the milk soft serve dessert which I was really looking forward to but wow, ikea soft serve anyone? Actually I think I like the ikea one better. It just wasn't great and with so many other better ice cream places in the vicinity, this one falls very, very short of all other options.  

Maybe this would be a good place to hang out in a nice set up with friends but for the cost of the mediocre food, head somewhere else if you're looking for something yummy. Pass.",1,1,1,positive

After we ordered it took quite some time to get our food. Our appetizer came out after our ramen dishes...which was a little bummer since we were starving and hoped to get the app in and eat right away. Our wait for our food seemed especially long given we got everything almost all together. 

The ramen was good but I've had better of this stuff...my friend had the extremely spicy ramen that they said was so spicy it came with soy milk on side and I tried it and wouldn't call it extreme by any means. I was expecting it to be pretty wild but it wasn't so bad. I mean don't get me wrong it's definitely spicy but nothing that you need milk with. 

My chilled spicy ramen was good, but I wouldn't call it chilled. It was essentially room temp ramen. I was hoping it would be chilled...I had it that was once before and liked it a lot since the coolness balanced out spice. But frankly this wasn't spicy enough anyway that the temp wasn't a huge need. Just would have been more a preference in this case. Some of the pork in my ramen had a little bit of an odd taste...I kind of think it has a chemically taste...not sure if cooking surface had something on it...the rest of the noodles and sauce were really good. 

Roasted rice cakes and the lamb buns were the stars of the meal. I don't know that I'd be back here in Toronto...I'll stick to my NYC location.",1,0,0,positive

As we waited for our reservation and for stragglers to arrive, we took in the late afternoon tea at the adjacent Lobby Lounge within the Shangri-La Hotel. What a civilized way to spend the afternoon!

We pre-ordered the fried chicken which includes 2 whole chickens, thin scallion pancakes and a number of condiments\/pickled accompaniments, as well as large Bibb lettuce leaves. It reminded me of a Peking duck meal. Each chicken was prepared differently: buttermilk, crispy Southern style and Korean style with a spicy red glaze. After a piece of each, I think the buttermilk version edged out the Korean one for its crunchy goodness. Of course, having a nephew continually whisper that the Korean chicken looked ""bloody"" did not help.

What stole the show however, were the ramen noodles. We shared a couple of bowls of the Momofuku ramen which included amazingly fresh, thick noodles in a flavorful pork broth with pork belly, thinly-sliced fish cakes and a perfectly-poached egg. I could have slurped a few bowls of those noodles and will have to return to try other variants.

For dessert, I had to have the crack pie. While it was not on the menu, I was certain that it was available. The thin pie had an oat cookie crust and a buttery, sugary filling. It was so good that I promptly ordered a whole pie, from the NY location, to savor.

Different tiers of his restaurant that people dressed from casual to fancy can dine at. I liked the layout and design of this restaurant and how they presented everything within. I had the Corn Ramen and I very much enjoyed it. The chicken was moist and he used the dark meat of the chicken (the best part), as we all know that he doesn't like the white part. The soup was light yet full of flavor. I recommend eating all of his ramen with kimchi if you are Korean, or if you just enjoy kimchi. He has put the kimchi in a clever jar, if you don't finish it you can take the jar home! I believe the reason why his restraint has such low reviews os because of the price, but for what he is offering such as presentation, environment, service, and food it is a very fair price. Also his ramen is not supposed to be the typical traditional super authentic ramen. If you have seen his show The Mind Of A Chef, then you would know otherwise. P.S. I was amazed by the cream ice cream, my tastebuds were shocked. It tastes exactly like the savory part of a bowl of cereal.

Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.  The portions were very tiny.  The salmon appetizer where three very tiny thin slivers.  The main were two very small drumsticks (at least use the Costco sized drumsticks).  The cake was a squished up Timbit.  The only item that tasted good was the drumsticks.

The pork buns didnt look too filling but definitely looked delicious. My friend doesnt eat much so it was fine for her but i would've probably needed at least two servings! 

The ramen was pretty on point but the egg was not what i was anticipating. I've been to quite a few ramen places and i always love their seasoned boiled eggs so i was really hoping that would be what was im this ramen but i was sorely disappointed. Its a lightly boiled egg with a runny yolk. I personally dont like runny yolks so it was hard to finish my ramen after i broke the egg, but if yolk is your thing, you would love this stuff. Im glad i finished most of my ramen before i broke the egg though because the broth was amazing! The noodles were a little hard but still tasted good and better than a couple other places i have tried! 

I think the icing on top of the cake was the soft serve we had after our meal. They serve two flavors of soft serve here: one that taste like fruity pebbles and one that tastes like your milk after having eaten cereal from it (sweet and cereal-y milk! Mmmmmm). I had a twist of the two flavors along with their crunch topping and was not disappointed! The only downside to their soft serve was probably the price. Its a small serving for the price. I payed roughly $6 for soft serve that fit into a tiny cup (the size of the little paper dixie cups some people use for mouthwash). It was so good, but the price was not worth it in my opinion.

We thought it was weird and explained that we would order first.  The hostess seemed to hesitate a bit but shortly after, we were seated thankfully.  I don't know what that was all about!

I soon noticed that there was also no where to put our bags and jackets and there was no coat check.  I asked if I could get an extra stool to place our bags and jackets and both servers said that they'd check but neither of them ever got back to me.  Perhaps I'm just picky but at least at Kinton Ramen, the stools have a small slot to place bags.

Next is the food...  I asked our server if the chicken buns were made with white meat and she said yes but when I got it, it was clearly DARK meat!  If I had known it WASN'T chicken breast, I would've just ordered the pork buns!  The only thing I liked about it was the deep-fried skin, which reminded me of JA-JEE-GAI (crispy Chinese chicken) but that was it.  I don't think I'd ever order it again.  People who like dark meat might like it though.  My boyfriend ordered the pork buns, which was actually quite tasty.  I recommend trying if you do decide to go.

My main was the Kimchi Stew, which consisted of pork shoulder, kimchi, and rice cakes; it also came with a bowl of rice.  I thought it was just ""OK"" - nothing special.  I was expecting something really spicy but it was just mild.

I also ordered the Seven Spice Sour Slushie, which had an interesting flavour.  I tasted the ""sour"" more than the ""spice"".  My friend on the other hand, thought it was too ""spicy"" for her.  I guess I have a really high threshold for spicy foods so didn't taste the spiciness in either the Kimchi Stew nor the Slushie.

At the end, my boyfriend and I ended up paying over $80-something for 3 orders of buns, 2 bowls of noodles, and a slushie.  I don't think I'd come back to this noodle bar because for the price we were paying, I was expecting better food and service.",3,0,0,negative

I need to keep thinking about the food there. Well, Momofuku didn't Momofukup in that department. 

I try not to review a place after only going once (unless I was able to sample a huge offering), so after going the first time and trying their Ginger Scallion Noodle, I really had to hold back. That was the best veggie dish I've ever had. I came back and got a taste of their bao and rice bowl and I think I'm ready to commit. UGHHH SO GOOD. I LOVE EVERYTHING. 

1) Ginger Scallion Noodle ($14 + $4 for Katsu) - Includes shitake mushrooms, pickles, pickled cabbage. Every different vegetable had a distinctly different flavour. My mind was blown. This wasn't some plain old noodle where all the veggies are similarly marinated. The Katsu was nice and crispy. The noodles were pleasingly chewy. I think this one's my favourite. 

2) Lamb Tsukemen ($18) - I learned that Momofuku's menu isn't stagnant when I came back wanting to order this, and it wasn't there! I had a bite of my friend's the first time I came. The dipping broth was Szechuan-inspired, red and numbing deliciousness. The lamb was super tender. 

3) Pork Belly Bao ($12) - You ever have pure decadence in your mouth? That comes in the form of melting pork belly, sweet hoisin sauce, soft Chinese bun, and a hint of pickle and scallions to cut through the fattiness when you think you can't take it anymore. 

4) Fried Chicken and Caviar Don ($20) - The fried chicken is different from the Katsu (not breadcrumb coated), but man that is some flavourful chicken!! The texture was crispy but the meat was moist. They use little trout caviar which offers a bit of resistance when you bite into them. Overall, it was an extremely interesting dish full of flavour explosions. I also had full-blown itis after it, so you know it's not a light lunch by any means. 

For ramen, this place is definitely on the higher end, but for the financial district, the food's a steal. You could be spending $30 on pre-prepped food that tastes the same at all the overpriced chain restaurants in the area. Instead, you can spend that money on some incredibly tasty baos and noodles. Moxies...Momofuku...you be the judge.

I personally didn't find their food ""wow"". Ramen portion was small, soup wasn't hot, and ramen itself was kina soggy. The tsukemen soup was only warm. Not too impressed with the quality and price. However, in my lamb tsukemen; the lamb was really tender and juicy. Aside the lamb... I think other stuff was a-ok meh to me. 

There is fried chicken platter which we saw people\/family ordering.. but it was a big portion and I think it was over $100. We didn't get that. 

The milk bar basically is cereal with milk soft serve. I wouldn't mind it, but again for pricing.. I think I wouldn't purposely come here for their dessert or picking up cookies. 
They have a milk bar fridge upstairs on the 2nd floor where customers can freely go up, pick their cookies and stuff then pay for it on the main floor cashier just before you go out the door.

I go to so many restaurants in the downtown core during Summerlicious for work lunches and dinners. And all other places I've participated in always make sure the dinner menus are different or at least portion sizes are larger as you pay a higher price at dinner.  Extremely disappointed in this restaurant that prides itself more of its cool factor than feeding their customers.  They served us 4 courses (we ordered mushroom buns as an extra item) in 35 minutes flat. The restaurant was not even half full at this point. They rushed us for no reason.

To be fair the salmon crudo and the inari were tasty. However the famous fried chicken was definitely overrated. The tiny strawberry lemon truffle tasted like cake pops you buy at Starbucks.",2,1,2,positive

We've been wanting to go forever, but usually tried to make reservations same-day for a Friday or Saturday, and never had any luck. Tip: Sundays are much easier to get a same-day reservation! It was pretty early so there were customers, but it wasn't packed. The atmosphere is very modern and clean. The waiters (all men) were really friendly and dressed very casually. The hostess was pleasant enough but had no personality whatsoever. It could have been a coincidence on this particular day, but I'm not a fan of the ""women act as decoration at the door in short, tight dresses, while the men get to serve and interact with customers and wear whatever they want"" setup. 

That being said, the food was soooooo good. I was disappointed that the pork buns weren't on the menu since I'd heard so much about them, but the girls next to us were eating some when we sat down, so I took it as permission to order them as well, which was no problem. We also ordered the shrimp buns. Both of them were DELICIOUS. The pork buns are melty, porky goodness, and the shrimp patties were well-cooked, and had a bit of a spicy kick. I want more now!

My friend and I both had the Momofuku ramen, and after all of the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect but we both LOVED it. It was piping hot, the noodles were chewy, the pork and kimchi were delicious and the broth was amazing. I was so full near the end of it, but I couldn't stop eating the broth. It was rich, flavourful, and perfectly seasoned. I added some hot sauce to make it a bit spicier, but it was pretty perfect. I know that this is food I'm going to crave regularly now.

We split a piece of the Crack pie for dessert, and it was good, but a bit too sweet for me (not that we didn't finish it). I can see why it has such a following, but my heart is with the ramen at this place. I did grab a pack of three birthday truffles from Milk bar upstairs, and those are really good. Like a cookie dough truffle with sprinkles - you can taste butter, sugar and vanilla, but it's not as uber-sweet as the pie. 

Oh, and the 7 Spice slushie was delicious too - nice and cold and refreshing on a hot summer day. Tart, not too sweet, and a bit of a peppery kick. Loved it. I'll definitely be going back to this place!",2,0,1,positive

The host was a little on the snippy side, but our servers were great. The atmosphere was very modern, but surprisingly they had high chairs. We started with some sake. $30 for a 300ml bottle that was made locally. We had hopes it would be awesome... it just wasn't. Ok, bad start, but the ramen is what we came for! We had the momufuku ramen & the garnjatang noodle. Both were just okay & pretty flavorless. There was hot sauce on the table, which we both used generously. My ramen had pork belly in it, but it just tasted steamed & not very flavorful at all. It came with two pieces which I ended up not eating. Such a waste! The garnjatang noodles were also just okay. They were in a light sauce with braised pork, but again it wasn't very flavorful at all. Thank goodness for hot sauce. The noodles in both dishes were the best part. Normally I love drinking the broth when I'm done with my ramen, but this wasn't the case. Our server took away an almost full bowl of broth with pork belly.

The presentation of the food is generally consistent and quite nice, though it always looks better than it tastes.

The atmosphere is always busy and it suits the setting -- with long benches and communal tables, and chopsticks and napkins out of a dispenser. I think if looking for a quieter meal, Daisho upstairs might be a better environment. Both times I visited, my party was done eating within an hour, and it almost felt like they were trying to vacate our table to accommodate others.

I was so excited to try this place.  We have Momofukus in NYC, of course, but I can never get a reservation.  So when a business lunch was happening here, I couldn't believe my luck.  

I LOVE RAMEN.  Fancy ramen, cheap ramen, crazy spicy ramen, cold ramen.... Love it all.  

We had the pork bun appetizers.  I thought, this is a good sign!  They were very good.  I mean, the pork buns I've had at Ippudo in NY were better, but hey, everyone has a different take on the classic, and these are good!  Sure, the pork was sort of heavily fatty... a little fattier than the pork really has to be... maybe a lesser quality cut of meat than in other places.  Ah well!  Forget it!  It was good anyway!

I ordered the Momofuku Ramen.  It looked good in the bowl.  I was excited to see a poached egg in the bowl (Yay!) and dug in.  Mmmm......?  The poached egg was VERY undercooked.  It was basically a raw egg.  Blergh.  Ok, get over it, let's have some broth!  I bet this broth is going to be savory, deep, flavorful, and just singing with-- hmmm... not so much.  Sort of... cold, actually.  Isn't the highlight of a good ramen (other than nice, chewy noodles) a hot, flavorful broth?  

Ok, so I ate the whole bowl and slurped down most of the broth.... but I was really surprised and sorely disappointed.  Trust me, I wanted to be impressed.  I wanted to love it.  But I don't know.  It was cold, the egg was raw, the broth wasn't flavorful at all, and the whole thing was just.... Meh.

I think I'm going to have to go to Ippudo in the very near future to wash that memory away.",0,0,0,positive

CONS: slightly overpriced, ramen was nothing special, good but overhyped
I was so happy to see Momofuku come to Toronto, especially since I am such a ramen fan! Though I found the food to be pretty good, I thought it was honestly nothing special compared to other ramen spots in the city, so I was a little disappointed.
We arrived at the restaurant and seated upstairs near the milk bar. It was kind of awkward seating for two people, so we asked to change and the staff were very accommodating! (Note: Ask for a table seat if you are 2-3+) There aren't many seats with backs and you sit right next to other customers (it's mostly picnic bench style), but we didn't have any noisy neighbors so it wasn't an issue!
The whole night we received great service and our food came out at a good pace. We ordered the pork buns and pork ramen. Pork buns were DELICIOUS. The pork is to die for!!! An absolute must. The pork ramen was pretty good; it featured the same pork that was in the buns, which was awesome, but the broth was kind of lackluster.
We finished off with cereal milk ice cream from the milk bar. Very interesting... tastes exactly as described: like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of cornflakes. Cool to taste, but once you get used to the flavor, it becomes odd (would YOU drink a whole glass of cereal milk?) and more like overpriced soft serve.
Honestly, the experience was fun! Don't just come her for the ramen, try other things on the menu. Delicious, but overhyped... and slightly overpriced. Take your Instagram photo, try a pork bun, and get your ramen elsewhere.",0,0,0,positive

The food is very little (smaller portions comparing to other restaurants that we tried). Moreover, it doesn't have a Wow factor as we all expected (since there are many  ravers about the place and the food). Besides that, our waiter (Brian, I think) was not welcome and friendly at all. He didn't take my friends' orders because they came in a bit later, they got served by the bartenders (we sat next to the bar)  instead.

His nikai on the second floor include Momofuku's various alcoholic creations. Why not try some to start the meal? Here we have  Smoke + Mirrors (tequila, spiced agave, chamomile, yuzu, bitters) and Shibuya Crossing (sake, tequila, vermouth, lemon juice, togarashi).  Both looking very similar and tasting similar too with the first drink tasting a lot stronger on the alcohol content. Even though these came in 2oz, they were enough to get me happy

And it's always nice when a restaurant gives a complimentary starter: popcorn. It was topped with some kind of spicy and salty seasoning that gave it a nice little kick! (I was even daring to drizzle sirarcha on it afterwards).

Okay, so people say Momofuku is known for his ramen and that's what the 3-hour wait in NYC was about, but I beg to differ. I think the real star of the show is the pork belly buns with hoisin, scallion and cucumber. They look plain and maybe a bit too simple, but never judge a book by its cover. These will fool you good because they are the most juiciest pork buns I can ever sink my teeth in. My taste buds were just loving the fatty juices that overflow my mouth. So intense in its porky flavor that I admit, I did come back the next day to order takeout while on a full stomach

And finally, the ""star"" of the show is the pork ramen with belly, shoulder, fish cake and egg. Hmm, can I be honest? I am glad I didn't wait 3 hours in NYC to try this ramen. I mean, don't get me wrong: it's good!!!!! But not worth a 3-hour wait. The broth is very clear and thin yet tasteful. The shoulder added more salty to the dish, but it may be a bit too salty for me.. =\ The noodles? Al dente and perfect! And what about that egg???? Ohhhhh, now we are talking about perfection!!!!!! Cooked so perfectly so that this egg is balancing on a very fine line between being undercooked to barely cooked enough to retain its softness and rawness. 

So I admit, I am guilty to coming back here twice in a row. I came back to even order take out and enjoy the pork buns on the street. It was so good, I didn't care!!!! Nothing makes me happier than to chow down these pork buns while squatting on the streets in the dark because I don't know when the next time is gonna be. Again? Total worth

Pros:
-very fast, classy, friendly service (attentive, detail oriented) 
-delicious out of this world pork buns 
-convenient located on second floor next to all his other restaurants 
-bakery on same floor
-has a bar 
-clean restrooms

About a month ago, I received an email from my very first boyfriend ever, we dated when I was 17 to 19 when we lived in Montreal. Recently, he googled me and found my blog. He is living in the U.K. now. He has a high falutin' London banker job and travels all over the world and was going to be in Toronto for a couple of days in May. Would I like to meet? YASSS! I am a time traveler and there was always this nagging, unresolved feeling when I reminisced about him, that there was some truth I had yet to discover.  He was the one I lost my tender virginity to and ultimately the one who set the tone for the rest of my failed relationships. This bitch, even with therapy, has to sleep with one eye open at all times. It's exhausting, and that's why I like being single now that I'm old. Anyway, we went out during the 1980s, before there were cell phones or even answering machines. Boyfriend (BF we'll call him from now on) would go on ""sabbaticals"" during our boning tenure, and disappear for a few weeks every 2 or 3 months or so. In other words, we broke up 4 times, but never formally, and he would always come back with some hand written note declaring his love and commitment and I always would take him back, just like that annoying Einstein meme definition of insanity that says doing something over and over again and expecting a different result is all kinds of fucked up. But I still have his letters in a box under my bed. ""I want to protect you from the perils of modern living"" is what he said in his last letter to me, the one where I didn't take him back cuz fuck that shit. This is where the title of my blog ""Art of Modern Living"" comes from. Bitches need to protect themselves, is my motto.

Anyway, he was staying at the Shangrila and we met in his room, because I love jumping on hotel beds and cutting to the chase. I haven't seen him in 30 years and he was wearing a suit (weird!) and all his hair was white, but he looked the same, kind of like George Clooney's brother from another mother. If you squint. We drank two bottles of wine and he told me the story of his life which was mind blowing actually. He lived in Hong Kong in the 90s and met his future wife who he married after accidentally impregnated her, holy shit, that is actually noble in this day and age....but! she recently left him and moved to another country in a whole other continent and took their 8 year old child with her but left the oldest one with him. KInd of wackadoodle but I don't judge. She kept calling multiple times during our date or whatever you want to call it and he kept stepping out to defuse her screaming, I could even hear her squawking from another time zone. The whole thing was tawdry, so to answer your question that I know you are thinking: No, we did not bone.

We did go to the noodle bar downstairs though. We ordered  pork buns to share and I ordered the house ramen and BF had the spring ramen. Pork buns were to die for! They were sweet and salty and soft and delicious and I have been dreaming about them ever since. My noodle bowl was salty, slurping pork fat heaven. I don't get why such bad reviews on here, like the pork belly was too fatty! The pork belly was too fatty, seriously? That's like saying George Clooney is too good looking. I actually laughed out loud at that and the particularly picky one about runny eggs being bad for pregnant woman, oh for gods sakes, that's such fear mongering modern smother mother bullshit ...the egg in the noodle bowl is supposed to drip and ooze like a surprise jizz explosion. The noodle bowl is a metaphor for life. Once you're finished sucking it all up, there's nothing left but a pool of broth. Some people will lift up the bowl and swallow the rest of life's precious liquid and the others will let the hipster waiter take it away, all that perfectly good broth, because they are too busy answering their goddamn phone for the millionth time. 

BF, who travels all through Europe and Asia and lived in Hong Kong, said it was the best noodle bowl he's ever had. So that is the final word on that, Toronto ramen snobs. And by the way, he also said the reason he kept disappearing all those years ago, was because  our relationship was ""too intense."" Whatever the fuck that means. He never answered the phone when I called him back in the days of primitive communication, ergo I never had the opportunity to yell at him like his crazy-ass fishwife.  I was always soft and sweet and yes, salty even as a girl, just like the Momofuku pork bun. One thing I know for sure, he'll come  back and there will be more noodles. And pork.",0,7,1,positive

Marinated cucumber - thinly sliced cucumber marinated in vinegar and sesame. It reminded me of a Chinese cold noodle dish minus the chicken. It was nothing much to boast about.

Inari - I've had their Inari before and quite enjoyed it. It hit the spot this time and nice balanced flavours.

Jajang noodle - I know it's a fusion dish, but I much much prefer the jajang mein at a Korean restaurant. I really disliked the citrus peel flavour in this jajang noodle. Overall it wasn't that great in flavours, but the noodles were at least cooked properly.

Ginger scallion noodle - again, nicely cooked noodles and nice flavours as you get to the bottom, but a bit oily.

German chocolate jimbo cake truffle - I've had their birthday cake and strawberry truffle in the past, and didn't have high hopes for these chocolate ones, and I was right. People say good things come in small packages, yet these clearly aren't working for me. It's super sweet and dense, and not even in a good way.

Walking in we had the option to go for the Noodle Bar or the upstairs restaurant (significantly more expensive and dinner-like menu for sharing). We decided on Noodles since it was lunch. My first impression of the waitresses and host were a little chilly and cold because of stress maybe? Meh.

I like the interior design and open concept, communal set up. We sat at the bar which was surprisingly comfortable and we had some live entertainment (chefs preparing food in a very ""assembly-line"" sort of way). Hey, whatever's most efficient at rush hour lunch.

The lamb noodle was excellent. Waaaay beyond my expectations because I normally don't order dry noodles. I would come back just for this dish.  **On a side note, the only noodles with soup are the House Ramen and Tan Tan Noodles (sesame based). Everything else is dry, which I found slightly surprising since I assumed a noodle bar would have more soup based options.** My boyfriend ordered the ramen and said it was pretty good. We try places out in Vancouver and obviously there are more authentic places but this one made it decently. But then again, we don't dissect ramen down to the green onion strand.

I don't understand all of the low reviews!  It's important to note that in order to get in in a timely fashion, you HAVE to make a reservation.  Over the past several years, I have made reservations and always been seated before or on-time.  I have always had excellent customer service from the staff and never a long wait for my food.
As far as the food goes, above everything else, you HAVE to order a pair of the pork buns!  Those fluffy steamed buns and the tender slices of pork belly...I can't.  It's a magical few bites that you will thank me for suggesting later.  Also, if the beef brisket bun happens to be on the menu that evening, that's very delicious and tender as well!  And there's a pickle in there!
My other favorite classic staple to order is the pork ramen.  Again with the tender pork belly slices but also with a poached egg, delicious broth, it's like a classic noodle dish with a modern twist.  It fills you up without leaving you TOO full, so you can still go out and enjoy the rest of your evening.
There is also an extensive beer and wine and cider list, and a little bar upstairs!  And don't forget to check out the Milk Bar and take a Crack Pie home.
Momofuku is honestly more than just a resturant, it's an experience...and one you do not want to pass up.",2,0,1,positive

We got there around 7 on a Friday night and as expected there was a bit of a wait. We went up to the second floor where they have a bar and had a couple of awesome cocktails. Try the hotel georgia!! The wait was about 30 minutes, and then we were seated. Now, I know everyone has said that the ramen isnt worth trying, but I just had to have it. And it didnt disappoint in the least! Rich and deep broth, bouncy noodles, slow poached egg. Perfect! It certainly isnt traditional ramen...its Momofuku Ramen, just like it says on the menu. I get the impression that Chef David Chang isnt interested in replicating a product...he puts his own spin on it; hence the ramen. My partner had the ginger and scallion noodles- also excellent. 
One thing that I think a lot of people forget when they have been, or go to, Momofuku in Toronto is David Chang's insistence on local product. I cant think of another ramen spot in the city that can claim that their meat is hormone free and local. And, my guess is that this is why the ramen is a mere $15.
Service was very efficient.

It was a great day for a warm bowl of ramen. I have frequented Momofuku on many occasions and have previously given the place 4 stars. However, I thought that my visit today was 5 stars worthy. The service was excellent. The food was creative and innovative. The menu has changed since the last time I visited. 

To start, we had the BBQ Pork buns. The buns are a Momofuku specialty and you are really missing out on the full Momofuku experience if you do not order the buns. While there are many imitations since Chef Chang introduce his buns over 10 years ago in NYC, nothing beats the original. The buns is essentially a reinvention of the classic Chinese BBQ Pork buns. It's innovative and flavourful. We also had the fried chicken with ikura which was amazing (who doesn't like fried chicken and ikura together). Dare I say it was almost better than chicken and waffles?

For the mains, we tried the TanTan Ramen and the Tuna Ramen (new addition to the menu). The TanTan Ramen (which comes with confit chicken, sesame, scllion and egg) was flavourful - both spicy and savoury. The Tuna Ramen was a nice contrast to the TanTan Ramen. The Tuna Ramen's broth was lighter and refreshing. The noodles were lighter. It came with fresh lightly seared tuna.  The Tuna Ramen is a healthy option for those who are looking for something lighter. 

For dessert, we had the famous cereal soft serve. It was a great way to end a delicious meal. While there are many other ramen places around town, Momofuku is more than a ramen shop. Come for the ramen but try the other dishes. You also do not feel like the wait stuff is rushing you out at Momofuku to turn the table. Momofuku is an experience. It is more than just a warm bowl of ramen.",0,0,0,positive

Food
Started with Pork Buns, made with hoisin sauce, scallions, cucumber, 2 pieces of pork and a freshly steamed 1\/4 inch thick bun wrapped around it all. $10.  
The bun is light and fluffy and absolutely delicious! This was so good we just stopped talking and ate.  

Momofuku Pork Ramen with pork belly, pork shoulder, fish cake and egg. $15
The broth had a good savory flavor to it.  They placed a light chili tomato(?) sauce in the center which added to more unique flavors. The pork has nice layers of fat to it. Noodles are slightly Al Dente which are just the right texture.  Ate the egg last since the broken yolk changes the flavor of the broth.  

Yunan Rice Cakes with tomato, basil, chili and goat cheese.  $12.  
Its long rolled up thick pasta sliced into mouth size bites reminiscent of gnocchi.  They added baby tomatoes and the outside has some crispness to it.  Interesting mix of flavors here.  

Dessert.  Double smooth ice cream with crushed corn flake sprinkles. A decent dessert to finish the meal.  

Atmosphere
Open setting with several groups seated at long tables.  It adds to the atmosphere sitting along side each other.

All of the food I had was delicious. I've never had real (not instant) ramen before, but have seen Chef Chang on Mind of a Chef and trust that, in terms of ramen, it's good. His knowledge of the subject is verrry expansive:

+ Brisket Buns: The best steamed buns I have had. Sweet, savory, umami, complex flavors and nice textures. Add sriracha for some heat.

+ Momofuku Ramen: Of course I had to get the ""signature"" noodles. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, the egg added creaminess to cut through the savory broth, the nori brought some unexpected flavors and was my favorite part of the dish.

It's definitely an interesting place to try if you're in the city, however, the price-to-quality ratio is a bit skewed if you're paying for your own meal.

The inari was interesting, but we weren't too fond of the taste. I'm a BIG fan of inarizushi in general. I found the stir fried rice to be a bit too soggy, and the flavours of the scallions and other elements didn't really work with the sweet inari wrap, IMO. The roe was a nice addition though. The inari are $6 for a single piece on the menu.

The cheeseburger okonomiyaki was... very bizarre. The kraft single was just awful inside the okonomiyaki. We make okonomiyaki at home, and I can imagine many other modern twists you can do to okonomiyaki that do not involve a cheeseburger. This dish is $14 on the menu. 

The fried cauliflower was nice and simple. No way to mess this up. We enjoyed this a lot, but we would not get this normally because of the price ($10). The smoked salmon was nice and fresh; very simple. It was the nicest part of our meal, but we did not see it on the regular noodle bar menu.",1,0,0,positive

We arrived at Momofuku after a short walk and were greeted as we entered.  They asked if we had a reservation, we did not, and they seated us immediately.

The young lady then gave us the day's menu and took our drink order.  When she returned with our drinks, we placed our food order: Pork Ramen for my wife and Pork Buns (could be my nickname) for me.

They have several seating arrangements from individual facing the outside or the chef area, to smaller tables possibly for reservations, and longer community style tables for those with no reservations like us.  Soon we were talking with new friends who were seated at our table shortly after us.

Then the food arrived!  I had not had this type of Pork Bun before so I was curious how it would taste.  It had a couple of very thin slices of cucumber and Hoisin Sauce and two thick slices of grilled pork belly.  It had great flavor but was a bit messy to eat...no points off for messy, ever, just saying.  The order was for two Buns.

Then the Pork Ramen was delivered to our table and the appearance seem unauthentic (using a poached egg instead of soft boiled) although I believe this restaurant is more fusion and new things than traditional.

Update:  So, in addition to being almost overcharged on my visit to Daisho (as mentioned in the initial review), I was checked my Visa statement and I was charged twice for my lunch at Noodle Bar.

Called Visa and they confirmed that the restaurant charged $98.xx to my Visa twice (once the day I was there, another time two days after) with the same reference number.

Ultimately, I just had to email Momofuku and their service director refunded the incorrect charge and responded within 3 hours with his apologies (though, no offer of compensation or explanation).  Glad I didn't have to physically show up to get this corrected (though, I would have loved to drop, 'Where's ma money, Momofucka?"") or dispute the charge with Visa (although, this would have been simple as Momofuku clearly incorrectly charged me).

My brother, who bought a Lucky Peach magazine was also double-charged for his purchase.  He checked his statement a few days after I told him what happened and he found the same issue.

I work in the financial industry -- if something as unusual as a customer complaining about a double-charge occurred, I would check to see if this was a systemic issue and proactively contact\/refund other effected customers.  It doesn't appear Momofuku were aware\/tried to contact\/refund my brother.  I can only hope the other diners there didn't have the same thing happen to them or they noticed the error.

Now, I'm not saying Momofuku is running a scam and I understand mistakes happen.  But from almost being charged an extra $20 on my 1st bill (minor server error) and then being double-charged on my second bill (possible employee fraud or major issues with their bookkeeping) -- what kind of an ass-backwards operation are they running?

Thank goodness we arrived 20min before opening since there was already a line up when we got there. We managed to get a seat right at the windows which was a little awkward considering the fact that people outside can watch you eat.

 I read a number of reviews and opt to go for the Momofuku ramen, the rice cakes, the pork buns, and the Slushie. I thought the ramen was alright but nothing to rave about. I did like the pork belly that was used in it. The rice cakes were great! They were chewy and had the right about of hotness to it (compare to the ones you would get at Korean places where it was just too hot!). The best part was the pork buns. The pork belly was so moist and tender and the bun was just so soft. I would definitely go back there for them. 

The Slushie was interesting. It was both hot\/sour and really hits you when you first take a sip of it. Really not for those who don't like hot\/sour tastes.
 
Overwall, I thought the Noodle Bar was good even though the ramen wasn't that impressive. But the prok buns did win me over and I wouldn't mind going back there to try the others. Just go to it with an open mind and not over hype it in your head and I think you would enjoy it.",2,0,0,positive

Many of the the classics from the east village original are there, but chef Hans Vogel of Momofuku Noodle Bar Toronto has also put some extra dishes that are very of-the-moment in Toronto dining, but still have the new york flare which Chang is famous for. Great Inari yields fluffy rice filling, seaweed, mayo, and melted swiss cheese, an unusual combo, but absolutely amazing. Pork buns feature supple bun, meaty pork belly with a nice sweet hum of hoison. Ginger scallion noodles are one of the best noodles on their short menu though the Momofuku ramen does not live up to the hype but it's tasty nonetheless. Lucky enough to eat once again during summerlicious lunch and found their famous fried chicken on the menu.

However, today's visit to Momefuku was FAR from pleasant. We had a reservation for lunch for 6 people at 12:30pm for a farewell celebration for a coworker.  By the time we were seated it was 1pm. 

Now I understand its winterlicious and they were very busy. Hell, I'm a forgiving person I even understand double\/ overbooking. What I don't understand is that why the hostess when we arrived (early at 12:25) said that it would be five minutes before we were seated and they were just cleaning up the table. Then when I asked her around 12:40 she said again, five minutes they were cleaning up the table. Then when my friend went to talk to her at 12:50 to explain that we have to leave at around 1:30 (1:40 latest) because we had to get back to work (and we work in a hospital) that she then finally said that the table is just ordering dessert and we should have the table in 10 minutes. 

So just to be clear when at 12:25 she said then 5 min and then 12:40 she said five minutes, the group hadn't even gotten their dessert yet. At 12:25 when I first asked, that table was probably just getting their mains. Then she continued to say 5 minutes every time we asked. If she had simply told us the truth when I first asked, we would have gone somewhere else (I would have been a little upset, but more understanding). But by the time she finally told us, it was far too late for that. 

We were finally seated at 1pm. Most restaurants, when you have people waiting with a reservation that long would offer something complementary, or a discount on the bill. But no, the staff at Momofuku didn't EVEN offer an apology (not for the late seating or for lying about the whole thing). When I tried to explain it to the waitress, the brushed me off and left while I was still talking! We ended up asking to get our food rushed. We had to speed eat so we barely got to enjoy the meal. 

The only pleasant thing I can say is that the food was good (which is what the two stars are for), but nothing exceptional (other than their cereal milk ice cream which i can't help but love!). However, considering all the options for delicious ramen around Toronto (that is usually cheaper with much nicer staff), I doubt I will be returning here.",1,0,0,positive
