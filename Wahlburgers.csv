How can you call yourself a burger joint when you eff up the patty?!! It was OVERCOOKED, there's a difference between medium cooked and still juicy vs OVERCOOKED and dry af. The same thing happened to 2 of my other coworkers as well so it didn't happen to just me. Not going back!",7,3,0,neutral

Ordered the melt which is almost $11 without fries which cost another $3.50.
SO ordered the original upped to 8oz patty with tater tots.

Service is friendly and prompt.  We received our drinks timely and the food didn't take that long to come out.  some of the other reviews commented on small portions.  We found all the food tasty and the portions were a good size and more than filling for an average appetite.  The melt was a perfectly toasted bread sandwiching a juicy patty with american cheese (they call it government cheese), pickles, onions, and mustard.  The fries were perfectly crispy and the tater tots were equally crispy and tasty.

The bill was $40 before tip for 2 soft drinks, 2 burgers, and fries and tater tots.  Yes, seems a bit pricey but it is downtown pricing and it is Wahlburgers.  I would say the burgers are better than Burger Works but not nearly as good as Burgers Priest if you're looking for comparisons.",1,0,0,positive

They have a nice little restaurant on Blue Jays Way near the Rogers Center. It has a nice design with an eat in area in the front and take out at the back near the kitchens. They also have a small balcony area for take out people to eat if there is room. We didn't want to wait for a table so we headed to the back for takeout.

I ordered the Double Decker and Fries while Bobby had the OFD (Originally from Dorcester) and some Tater Tots. We both really enjoyed our food. Everything was really fresh and tasted great. Next time I think I will get the triple because I was still a little hungry but that's my fault for not getting enough.

We were lucky enough to score a table upstairs to eat so we hung out, ate and watched the Jays fans make their way to the game. I will definitly be eating here next time I go to a game.",3,1,3,positive

My boyfriend's burger was slightly more edible. He had the BBQ burger. He also ordered a side of Mac and cheese that resembled soup with bread crumbs and bacon on top.

Not impressed with the decor. The prices, including the drink menu, were on the high end of average. The place seemed to want to have a home-y feel, but it just didn't. Plastic green chairs don't seem to work with $15 drinks- it just seemed gimmicky. Pictures of the Wahlburgs everywhere, obviously, and TVs playing clips from Mark's movies. I don't know what else I expected, but it seemed a little weird.

Food- the food actually was good. The burger, which was around $11, was fantastic! It didn't come with sides, which made it overpriced. The group I was with got tater tots and onion rings as sides. The tater tots were good, the onion ""rings"" were actually the kind of crispy onions that are supposed to go on a burger. Good, but hard to eat? 

The 2 stars were for the very good burger, the three missing are for the service. The server forgot both of our sides. She mentioned that they had just opened, which I totally understand, but her forgetting to put in half of what we ordered has nothing to do with them just opening. Their debit machine was down for a few minutes- THAT is 100% not her fault. Putting the order in was. Service was also slow, and we'd been finished for at least 15 minutes before anyone came to see if we were done, wanted a bill, etc.

Also, 18% service charge. Really? Someone below said that if you complain about 18% you shouldn't be eating there, but I disagree- it's the principle. I always try to tip decently well. (Management wise- I wonder if the servers SEE all of those tips.....) 

I would go again for take out only. Not to dine in. And even so, for the price, I'd probably end up elsewhere.",7,2,1,positive

We ordered the ""our burger"", the Dorchester, sweet tots and onion rings. We loved the ""our burger"" and ended up ordering another round of the our burger. (Definitely could easily eat 2 burgers). The first ""our burger"" was cooked medium to medium well on some areas, which OK considering it was stated on the menu that, that's how it's cooked. However I would of liked it if it were either consistently medium or consistently medium well... Not just different areas! Also the onion rings (as stated on the menu)... Umm I expected rings not shreds of deep fried onion. Wasn't sure how to eat it... Went from eating few shreds of a time by hand to using a fork, which wasn't very effective. Beware of the ""onion rings"". The sweet tots were ok. Overall, the ""our burger"" stood out the most.

It took quite a longer time than the usual fast paced burger joints to get our burgers served. However the staff were friendly.

Instead this place was one of the most disappointing places I have ordered food from. We placed a phone in order and went to pick it up for 4 adults and two children. The person who picked it up asked if the staff could double check the order  to make sure the order was complete. Well many things were missing. This was one person returning to our room with many bags. They could packed the numerous bags in one larger one making it easier to carry but they did not. They missed out on all the condiments and I mean all. Not even a napkin was offered. On the menu it states all their burgers are topped with dill pickles, cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Well ours came with none of these things. The meat was too salty. The food was given to us cold. The tater tots are pictured with dipping sauces which were not offered. There were no lids on the tater tots allowing them to get cold quickly on the walk from the restaurant through the hotel back to our room. The grilled cheese sandwiches ordered came as one grilled cheese. We had two kids to feed. The only thing decent was the Macaroni salad.

I was extremely disappointed in my experience here. I live in Detroit and frequent the location in Greektown. The people are always so nice and attentive and prompt. This is the same behavior I expected while in Toronto but I didn't receive that. We were staying in the adjoining hotel, The Soho Metropolitan for my birthday which is July 6th. My boyfriend went to the location on July 5th and arrived at 9:54pm. He asked the hostess, who was actually really nice, if they were closed and could he order food. Her response was absolutely. He said okay, and proceeded to the line to order food. The person taking the order asked was it for here or to go, his response was ""here"". The cashier looks at him and says, ""You do realize we close in 5 minutes?"" My boyfriend responds, ""I just asked the girl at the door if it was okay to order food and she said yes."" The girl responds, ""Well we aren't allowed to tell you that you can't come in if it's before we close."" He says okay and proceeds to order the food. He orders two sandwiches and two orders of fries both with the pickles on the side. When they called him, we noticed the food in a bag. I said, ""Oh you ordered it to go?"" He says no. He walks over the girl gives him a weird look when he said I thought I told u for here. While we were figuring out what sandwich goes to who he realized there was only one side of pickles. He goes back and says can I have another side of pickles. She asks for the pickles and the cook in back yells, ""Kitchen's closed."" Now, my boyfriend owns a bar, ironically, a burger bar. So he knows how things should be handled in this situation, so he gets upset. He says to the cook, ""Well had you done it right the first time I wouldn't have to come back and ask for anything."" The cook says something that I couldn't hear and my boyfriend says, ""I can't believe how rude you people are."" There were two ladies sitting in a booth near the counter and kitchen and one speaks up. My boyfriend asks if she is management. She asks what's the problem, he asks again if she is management and she respond yes. He says, ""Your employees are rude. If they didn't want to serve us they should have said that when I arrived and asked about ordering. They didn't give me my order correct. I ordered it for here, they give it to me in bags, and now your cook is yelling from the back of the house. It's extremely rude."" She responds, ""Well sir, the cooks are rude to us too."" He said, ""Well you need to fire them. I own a bar and this behavior would never be tolerated."" He then tells me we can go eat elsewhere after I apologized for suggesting we go in the first place. We left without even touching the food. He tells the manager have a nice night and we leave. We paid $35.31 for a meal we couldn't even enjoy, $20 of it was in USD, which makes it actually $41.07 paid. Its super upsetting that while on vacation for my birthday, going to a place I usually love to go to, this happens. I definitely have no desire to return.",1,0,0,positive

My friend likes Turkey burgers and with the recent review by a fellow Yelper (Thanks Billy K for cutting through the riff raff and providing an honest review) for Thanks Giving burger this was the choice we stuck with. We ordered a kids burger (beef) as the third person dining with us wanted a small portion (great value as its comes with a choice of a side) for sides we had sweet potato tots, onions and fries. 
The order took its time (15-20 min) and when we opened up the food at home it was still warm. 
On to the burgers nicely done a big pattie covered with stuffing. We also had caramelized onions as topping which went well.  Decent burger I would say 3 stars.

It's a much larger space than I thought.  There are two floors, a bar area, an open kitchen and lots and lots of very green chairs. 

TV's broadcast various sports programs but you can always be assured the Wahlberg montage will be in rotation which features the best of Donny, Mark and whatever the other guy's name is. 

The servers seem to forget they work in a burger joint in a tourist area and not a hole in the wall on Ossington. Just because you are wearing  black T-shirt, it doesn't mean you need to act like WE should feel privileged to be there.  At least the shirts aren't green though....

As for the food, the burger was good. I went with the Bacon BBQ.  The meat\/bun ratio was good and the patty was an acceptable medium-well (although I really wasn't asked).  I liked the Wahl sauce and BBQ sauce, both of which I asked for on the side.

As for the sides, they were terrible.  The fries and tots were synonymous with something my daughters would heat up after school. 

It's good in that you can sit and have a beer with a burger and watch television which is a surprising rarity among many of the popular joints in the downtown core. That said, you can get a good microbrew as long as you want to pay at least $7 for it. It's a bit ironic considering their menu concept which promises a reflection of humble beginnings and government cheese. I'd think a Bud Light might be a better call.

The concept is a little confused.  It can't seem to decide if it wants to be a chic burger bar or a family joint where you can get food made by famous people at a somewhat reasonable price. My guess is that Wahlburgers will likely draw the baseball crowd more than it will the patrons of the SOHO.

I think I could replicate my experience with a green sharpie highlighter, a pound of hamburger, a Kraft single, a bag of McCain fries\/tots and a toaster oven while   watching Muchmusic retro while I talk to my annoying hipster cousin on speaker phone.

Stuck between 2 and 3 stars but the burger saved it.

That said, the place is SO OVERPRICED. For two drinks and two burgers, our bill was $60. Also, there is a MANDATORY 18% gratuity. Even if you only eat as a couple, like us.

While the food was overall good, albeit fairly average, two things irked me. First, their ""pints"" are not pints. They are glass-sized bottles. $7 for a pint is steep; $7 for considerably less than a pint is scandalous.

The second thing is the mixed drinks: all are $12, and to be honest, it was not only garbage, but it came in a champagne glass. For $12, I would have expected a drink twice that side.

Part of me thinks the prices are so ludicrous because of the tv show. Maybe. Maybe this restaurant is a cash grab on hype. Maybe take your $60 and go to one of many better, more affordable, non-mandatory gratuity joints in Toronto instead.",9,3,1,positive

My out of town sister wanted to see this place since she's what I've described above haha. And I knew the minute we walked in, she wasn't the only out of towner. This place evokes the same atmosphere as Hard Rock Cafe or Niagara Falls. I wouldn't be surprised if no locals eat here. 

We were greeted at the door and explained the two different routes we could take: full, sit down service or head to the back for fast food. We chose to sit down and take in the whole experience. 

It took forever to get our drink orders in. There were probably 2-3 servers working and maybe 5-6 tables with customers but we waited really long just for the initial order. We watched customers arrive and head to back, order and head up stairs with food before we got served.

Once we did order, we found the portions small and the food mediocre. They serve the food in baskets and provide metal utensils which I found odd. The burger itself is dry and nothing special. I enjoyed eating the tater tots though they could be a bit more crispy and warm.

The Menu descriptions are charming (""Triple decker: a triple stack, like the house we grew up in""). The topping combinations were appealing, I had the ""OFD"" with mushrooms, swiss, tomato jam and bacon, which was as you can imagine quite tasty. Poutine was good, the cheese was plentiful and the gravy was beefy. The onion rings were actually onion strings, which weren't bad, but i wouldn't choose it again. You did get a good portion size, though, since more were able to fit in the cup. 

The main thing: the patty. I have rather high standards and have never paid for one that is better than what my dad makes. But it didn't taste like a frozen or processed, it tasted like fresh ingredients. I was happy.

These talented brothers not only act, dance, sing, and have their own reality show (Wahlburgers) but they also know a thing or two about a damn good burger.  Ever since they were kids, they've always had a passion for burgers, comfort food and making girls scream (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch YEAH!!) and so together the boys opened up their first Wahlburgers location in Hingham, MA in Oct 2011. 

The brothers were very excited to finally open their first franchise in Canada this past November 2014 inside the Soho Metropolitan Hotel making it the first North American expansion outside of the original restaurant in Hingham. The location seats 120 and offers a casual atmosphere with a sports bar, seated dining area and fast service counter. 

The menu includes a long list of burgers (custom-grind using 100 percent Canadian beef), sandwiches, salads, tater tots, fries, mom's macaroni salad, and onion rings. Alcoholic beverages are available such as as adult frappes, wahl-coctions, wine, beer and mixed drinks.  A cool feature that is available only at Wahlburgers Toronto is a beer made by Mill Street Brewery exclusive to the Toronto location, it's called the 'Wahlbrewski North' and it's one helluva an IPA!


Here's what I tried:

Thanksgiving Burger (Mark's Choice)
Fresh ground season turkey, stuffing, Paul's orange cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash and mayo $9.95

This turkey burger isn't around just for Thanksgiving; this bad boy is always on the menu and happens to be my favourite item so far.  I usually don't order turkey burgers because they tend to be dry but this one was quite juicy and full of flavour! All of the toppings really added different flavours and textures and the combination was just incredibly delicious! The taste of the squash especially added exceptional flavour to the burger.

O.F.D (Originally from Dorchester)
8 oz. beef patty, house made tomato jam, bacon, Swiss cheese and sautéed mushrooms $11.95

This big burger was pretty good but not as flavourful as I thought it would've been. The tomato jam was good but quite mild, I would've liked a dollop of BBQ sauce to give this burger a bit of a kick.  The patty itself was thick and juicy and cooked to perfection! 

Sweet Potato Tots $3.50

These are served with a nice chipotle sauce and are pretty addictive.  I've always been a tot fan so it was nice trying them out in sweet potato form. 

Alma's Macaroni Salad
Elbow macaroni, red onion, sweet peppers, parsley & mom's creamy mayo dressing $4.50

This is a classic recipe by momma Wahlberg that the brothers loved while growing up. It was pretty basic tasting and I felt that there was not enough dressing on it.  Perhaps I just got a batch that was lacking dressing...

Truffle Cookie
Gluten-free chocolate truffle cookie $1.95

These warm little cookies look plain but TASTE amazing.  I need to figure out if I can buy these by the bag because they are ridiculously addictive.  They remind me of a flourless chocolate cake, but in a little cookie form.  Highly recommend for a sweet treat after your meal.

Overall I had a wonderful experience at Wahlburgers and everyone that worked there was a complete delight.  I would definitely return to Wahlburgers especially with friends from out of town who want a feel for the city. Starting this month Wahlburgers will incorporate Canadian-themed dishes as part of the 'burger of the month' program and hopefully when they've perfected the 'greatest poutine ever' we will see something like that on the menu.",2,1,1,positive

And it is quite expensive (gourmet burger pricing). Our order of two burgers, two sides and one shake came out to over $40 for take-out.

The stand-out is really the sweet potato tots. These are truly addictive! I recently found out they increased the price from $3.50 to $4.50 without increasing the portions. They couldn't even top it off! It's such a jip and it kills me because these tots are SO good. I also liked the deep fried onions as they are stringy and not your typical thick-cut onion rings. Also had the Thanksgiving burger and double stack burger. Both were good but the size of the patties were just very sad.

A lot of reviewers mentioned confusion over the layout. Here's how it works: There is dine-in with bar service on ground level (wait to be seated). Cashiers are located all the way in the back for take-out orders. BUT there is seating upstairs for take-out orders (no table service).

Took absolutely no time for me to settle on getting an ""eh? burger"" and a poutine.   After all, I'm Canadian, eh?

Last year, I learned that if a burger has an egg on it, order that burger.  Hence, the ""eh?"" burger.

This ""eh?"" burger is, by far, one of my top 5 (if not top 1) burger of all time.

If you've never had a burger with a egg on it, you haven't lived.  Lift the bun, poke the yoke and let the yoke ooze all over the burger.  Replace bun, and enjoy.

The poutine was also excellent.

The BBQ burger at $9.95 was as dreary as all the other reviews state.
It was Luke warm, small, and covered with a few extras that were all pretty much a mush of stuff.
Bun was tiny but I guess for the tiny meat patty it was in order. The bun was above cardboard by a bit.  Totally inappropriate for a specialty place that makes a big deal about its burgers.
No plate to dip your fries in ketchup so we put a nappy on the table and poured the ketchup on it. The fries were undistinguished and don't even give Big Mac fries a run for the money.

Needless to say when I found out there was a Wahlburgers coming to Toronto months and months ago I knew I had to go. I mean c'mon! This is a family that pisses success. Mark had Planet of the Apes and Fear, Donnie has Saw and Blue Bloods and surely Paul would have hamburgers (and accoutrements). 

However, I never was able to find time to take a trip to Wahlburgers. That all changed tonight when a few co-workers (maybe someday full blown friends?) and I went after work!

This burger is ""A-OK"" (as yelp! described my choice of a 3 star review). The burgers are more or less on par for the price point of a small chain burger in the area. You're looking at roughly 15-20 dollars for a combo which is expensive but at this point I'm sure you're used to it. They have some unique options and a lot more poultry than you'll see at other burger places in the area. Their choice in salads and ""tots"" is also a nice change that I'm sure is tasty. I tried neither but the onion skins were delicious if not a tad greasy.

At the end of the day Wahlburgers gets the job done and is LLBO. The fact remains that their are too many 4 and 5 star options around for me to go back any time soon.",1,1,0,positive

I'm a diehard NKOTB fan so, quite obviously, once I heard that Donnie, Paul and Mark were going to expand their chain all of the way up here to Toronto- the countdown commenced..... more than once because the opening date kept changing, but whatever.
Anyways. The day came. I had checked out the menu online, so I knew roughly what to expect. The restaurant is clean and bright with lots of homages to the two celebrity brothers plastered all over the walls and televisions. It's fast food meets sports bar meets cafeteria meets sit-down restaurant. Nice, casual vibe with friendly staff- but the seating is lacklustre and spaced a little too closely together. The seats are lime green and feel cheap. They sell merchandise, but it's nothing special and slightly overpriced.
Now- down to the food. 
Firstly- it came quickly. No more than 10 mins tops.
My boyfriend had a burger with sweet tater tots and I had the melt sandwich with French fries.
Burger- flavour was good, bun was good, meat was slightly overlooked and dry. 7\/10.
Tater tots- slightly warmer than room temperature and wish they had a crispier texture. 7.5\/10
The Melt- 10\/10. One of the bed sandwiches\/burgers I've ever had in my life. 
Fries- comparable to Burger King. Crispy and flavourful but over-salted. 7.5\/10

I would 100% go back and try something new. I think it's adorable that they have their mother's pasta salad as a menu item. Jenny McCarthy also has a chicken sandwich on the menu. Too bad I hate Jenny McCarthy.

An automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill, so just don't be surprised when you see that circled in pen by your waitress when it's presented to you.",1,2,0,positive

We came in on this passed Friday night. As soon as we walked in it seemed to be not the busiest night but still full enough. We saw 2 hostesses seating and clearing tables which we later got their names on the way out because of their exceptional customer service in dealing with my family. The hostess that was what looked like stationed at the door failed to pay us any mind and seemed to be holding more of a personal conversation with her what seemed to be her boyfriend. We wandered for a minute wondering where to go until both of the other hostesses immediately ran over to see if we were helped. And promptly cleared and sat us at a booth in the back and apologized on the confusion and even gave us recommendations on what we're their favorites. 

Our great server Bianca came over within 5 minutes to take our drink order and asked if we were ready to order or needed some time. She quickly returned back with our drinks. The food came within reasonable time. The BBQ bacon burger was what I expected and I was not disappointed. My wife got the same and my son got the children's chicken fingers which came in a much larger portion then I thought and was very pleased with that. The remainder of our night was enjoyable, our server and the two vibrant hostesses we spoke with early came to check on us and see if we had everything we needed and how the food was. 

Overall I would recommend people to come dine in and experience wahlburgers. I will be coming back with my family. I just wanted to write a review to change the bad rep that's been put on wahlburgers.",0,0,0,positive

Lets start with the fries for $3.50 you would expect a full container but instead they serve you a half full cup of fries.  Potatoes are the cheapest thing you can serve...why do they feel it necessary to skimp so much?
Next the burger.  Decent size but not large by any ones standards.  Really no flavour to it.  I had bacon and cheese on mine and I think there was only once piece of bacon and not a lot of cheese.  For some reason they butter the bun so it is unnecessarily greasy which is too bad because its actually a decent bun.  I spend about $20 on a burger, fries and fountain drink and left disappointed with the food.  If you are going to charge $10 for a burger you better make it a lot better than that.

Yes, it's in the Soho Hotel, around the corner from Luckee. Yes, it's the new hot thing. But sadly, no, it's not that great.

So just to be clear, there's nothing particularly wrong with it (unless you count the rotund fellow wearing a FORD NATION shirt, while chowing down with his family. But seriously, there's nothing ""wrong with it."" The burgers seem fresh, the buns are fine and everything is just, well, fine. But that's the thing - they are not particularly flavourful or there is nothing about the meat or the sandwich that screams ""THIS IS A WAHLBURGER!"" If I was to blind taste test a series of burgers I would not know I had one.

We tried the BBQ burger, which came highly recommended, with the sweet potato tots and macaroni salad on the side. I think the macaroni salad was my favourite thing we ate. It tasted like it had been made from scratch, not too much mayo. Just fresh. Good.

Pricewise, the burgers seem pretty reasonable at about $9.75 each but none come with a side, not even fries. So if you want a burger and, oh I don't know, maybe some fries, expect to pay the usual overpriced Toronto standard of $15 and up.

Another thing that was sort of presumptuous was that 18% gratuity is added to any and all bills. The service wasn't bad, other than a mix up that had the food runner ""selling"" our plate because he didn't know what table to bring it to, but it would have been nice to know before ordering that 18% was being tacked on just for transparency's sake.

There are TVs all around the restaurant and at the bar that show basically one of two things: sports games and clips from the Wahlburgers reality show on a loop. It didn't appear that anyone who was in the restaurant gave a dingo's kidneys about either. I mean, it's in the tony Soho hotel so that doesn't exactly scream Boston sports bar. This is Toronto baby; we're too cool for everything.

I guess final verdict is that in a city that is so inundated with burger joints, one would thing that Wahlburgers would bring something more to the table other than the fact that it bears the name of the Wahlbergs.",8,1,1,positive

The Our Burger, Paul's choice!. It may look small and at 5oz it's not big but I don't think it's small either. A local gourmet burger joint I'd say is what everyoe compares burgers to these days comes out at 4oz so it's bigger than them. Thing is 'gourmet: burgers are tall, not flat. If they were flat, you'd get a bigger bun.

People ask well how does it compare to this 'gourmet' burger? Well I think the bun holds up better. And it's quote tasty so I like it.

The issue here is that Wahlburgers is not sure whether they are gourmet or fast food. Sit down or take out. So I sit down, the service is quite good and attentive. They serve the burgers in a basket which is indicative of takeout I think. So at this price point you don't want to feel like it's takeout. They have tater tots and sweet potato tater tots. I personally like the tater much more than the sweet potato ones. The sweet potato ones are more sweet than expected. Don't forget about the buffalo sauce, it's a great dip.

They seem to have difficulty finding space for a group of 6. Their tables just are not made for this; generally for 2s and 4s. So they could figure that out.

Also, it says it's child friendly and they do have high chairs and booster seats. But no table for changing in the restrooms.

I think if they figure out what they are it'll do fine. It's a bit expensive for fast food, but if they can figure out how to make it not feel fast food then the price point is quite competitive. Burgers do taste good, I like the tater tots. Fries looked good too! And make sure to not retract the waiving of 18% service charge, I want my choice in what tip to give.",2,0,0,positive

Sometime in 2014 Mark, Donnie, and Paul Wahlburger expanded their burger shop exploit into Toronto. I have to say, I was skeptical. It's easy to toss a celebrity name on something (Trump University) then make tall claims. But hey, my friends wanted to go, so we went.

When you enter the restaurant you realize that 1) this is more than your run-of-the-mill burger stop, and 2) Marky Mark put a fair bit of that Ted 2 money to use here. There are two floors, a full bar, flat screens lining the walls, and some pretty nice decor. Think of it like a gourmet burger restaurant, where you can drink, and appreciate some shameless advertising of Mark's past theatrical works.

With an ever present skepticism, and on waitress recommendation, I ordered The Melt and a side of Sweet Potato Tots. First off, I'm not sure what kind of sweat shop they have in the kitchen, but damn do they bring out your order quickly. Now at this point I'm going to have to restrain my desire to use expletives to explain how in LOVE I am with these mother****ing sweet potato tots. You know that you've discovered something precious when on first bite you can't contain audible excitement. Like HOLY S***.
Anyway, after collecting myself I started on The Melt. On first glance, this looks like a fancy grilled cheese. Between their in-house made thick-cut bread is a beef patty, grilled government cheese, pickles, caramelized onions, bacon, and mustard sauce. What you get first is that beautifully buttered and toasted thick-cut bread. Then you proceed to dive into a cheesy and beefy comfort, that is reliably supported with bacon, and (somehow) more notably the caramelized onions. A really satisfying burger.

After all that, I was so happy with myself that I got Thanksgiving Day burger as well. Think of a turkey burger with the classic Thanksgiving Day toppings. And yes, that includes cranberry sauce. (Very good, but not the best they have.)

In conclusion, I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong. Wahlburger serves up some stellar burgers, a cool atmosphere, and the most God-the-f***-damn intoxicating tater tots you'll ever have. So how does Wahlburger rank on the burger hunt? It's coming out at a strong #2, tied with Holy Chuck, and right behind Toma.",1,2,0,positive

I ordered the Our Burger, Sweet Potato Tots, and Iced Tea. Total was $17 something.  Other reviewers have complained about the automatic 18% gratuity which did make me pause. But you can skip that and head to the back take out counter and order from there where no gratuity is added. They have a decent sized section of tables near the counter reserved for people who order from take out (same food menu).  So basically if you don't want table service just head to the back and you should have no problem grabbing a table after getting your food (no automatic gratuity). 

The burger was a bit smaller than other burger places (I ordered the single Our Burger not the double or triple) but with that and the sweet potato tots it was definitely a full meal. Burger was very tasty. Comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, cheese, and their special wahlsauce. I'd certainly order that again. You can add additional toppings for extra cost (think caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, crispy bacon, white cheddar, blue cheese, onion rings, avocado). 

Sweet potato tots were good.....probably a good complement to their Thanksgiving Burger.  The side order was quite large. 

My friend ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger with Tater Tots and Alma's Macaroni. She loved the meal.....raved about the burger! I tasted the macaroni salad and can say it was quite good...fresh tasting. 

On my next trip I plan to try the Wahlbrewski (locally brewed IPA.... I've read it's a special brew from Mill Street). It goes for $7 \/pint. Oddly their bottled beers seem over priced (bottle of Corona for $8?) I can only assume they're strategically priced to push the Wahlbrewski....

They have burgers at 8 ounces and burgers at 1\/3 of a pound. Why on earth can't they stick to one measurement unit? Worse than that, their 1\/3 lb burger actually comes in two different patty sizes at two different price points. It's listed on the menu as a 1\/3 lb and suddenly you get a choice of how big it is. What? I was so confused by the waitress I just pointed at the menu. 

And it's creepy that they call American cheese, ""government"" cheese. Calling it government cheese makes it sound like it's going to be full of mold, maybe old and rancid, and kind of disgusting. Like it's been stuck in some government warehouse since the 1950s.

Burger was okay, nothing fantastic. Onion rings however, we're out of this world. Thin and lightly battered, with sea salt. Absolutely delicious.

Even though the place is pretty close to me, I haven't tried it until tonight. Based on the reviews, it's been a mix of hits and misses, some likes it, some hates it. We decided to do the take-out instead of the restaurant part which was in the front of the restaurant. The take-out was at the back and they have seating at the back and some upstairs. You can avoid to pay the automatic 18% gratuity!

They have a variety of selection of burgers to chose from. I decided to try the Thanksgiving Day burger as it is the first time I have heard of it so it's worth trying. It is like having Thanksgiving leftovers on a bun with ground turkey, stuffing, orange cranberry sauce, roasted butternut squash & mayonaise. I actually like it, it wasn't as greasy compared to other beef burgers. And it went great with the stuffing and squash. The burger was unique, worth trying! The burgers are smaller compared to the other gourmet burgers, I was hungry after a few hours compared to others where I would be stuff for the night. We got some sides as well, the onion rings were really good. Not your usually one big ring but its shredded onions with seasoning and battered then fried.

The wait, even for take out was pretty long. As they serve in the same kitchen so they are cooking for the restaurant and take out. So if you are tight for time, you might have to leave some buffer time. We waited for about 20 minutes for the food.

So here's the thing - we came here around 9:40 PM on a Wednesday evening right after a Blue Jays game over the summer (it's about a 5 minute walk from the Rogers Centre, and also within walking distance from the entertainment district). The place wasn't busy, there was no lineup (yet), and our stomachs were begging for sustenance. Because they weren't busy, we received our order right away, piping hot, crispy, and fresh (I ordered onion rings ($3.50) and their Signature 'Our Burger' (around $9.50)). We grabbed a clean table and actually really enjoyed our meal. 

The verdict? Pretty good! It isn't the best burger I've ever had, but it wasn't terrible either. I can understand the bad reviews below - our visit time occurred during off-peak, weeknight hours, where they could potentially put more effort into making our food. Regardless, the burger was hot and fresh, and the onion rings were super unique and different from anything we've had before - super, extremely thin, very crispy, and seasoned quite well (think of Hickory Sticks as onion rings, and that's pretty much what it is).

The overall quality of the food was good (but not great) and the people are friendly but as far as burgers go, there are quite a few other places that are better including Burgers Priest and Burger Works.

The space is divided into 3 areas; a bar, a full service area and a self service area. The bar seems to be the best compromise of actually being in the main part of the restaurant without having to wait for table service. The self service area is fine with tables and a few booths as well as some upstairs seating (which is small and secluded, near the washrooms). Also, small note, but dirty washrooms are really a thing of the past (or should be) for any restaurant that wants to get repeat customers. Get that _____ cleaned up!

The downtown location is close to the Rogers Dome and the expectation of huge crowds from Jays games and other events was probably a major factor in deciding the location. The entrance is located right across from Wayne Gretzky's and that's the easiest way to find it. There's a lot of construction next door so it might be easy to miss.

We had a BBQ Burger and a Double Stack, the poutine and Alma's chicken sandwich. The BBQ is a 5 oz patty which is ""smallish"" but well put together and juicy. The double stack features two 3 oz patties that when stacked on top of each other make it very messy to eat and you'll be left with no meat and lots of toppings. The fries used in the poutine are a bit small and don't seem to be hand cut. The best item we had, ironically enough, was the chicken sandwich.

All of our items seemed to have a bit too much ""special sauce"". And as for the price, yes it is a bit high but maybe that comes with a glimmer of hope that you might see a celebrity. We paid $32 for the BBQ Burger, Double Stack, Poutine and 2 drinks.

Busier and nosier mix of tables\/booths closer to the bar, doors open so you can get fresh air while you eat, but still technically indoors. Closer to the register are more booths and tables that are usually empty and therefore more quiet. Some large TVs there as well -- tonight happened to have a reel of Donny and Mark Wahlburg, and some of their family. 

We did takeout a couple times, and service was always so fast. Both nights we waited 10 minutes. Plenty of condiments, utensils, napkins to help yourself to. Beats having to ask someone to give you adequate amounts of those things. Guy manning the register was friendly when taking our order and patient when I got confused with their current menu versus the online one

Most of the food was really good :

Our Burger- This comes with Wahl sauce? Not sure what that is, but all I saw was melted cheese. There was no other discernible taste of said sauce. It suited me because I like a basic standard burger without any fancy dressings or sauces to gussy it up.This was a great burger, always hit the spot. Patty not too thin, not too thick, and was the proper ratio with the toppings\/bun. It's not a large burger\/patty, definitely not the size of a diner or Chili's burger.

Hot dog- Couldn't really mess this up. They gave the tiniest ramekin of sauerkraut. 

Grilled cheese with tomato and bacon - lots of cheese, gooey, and buttery bite. Had chopped up bacon pieces rather than strips inside. 

Chicken fingers - Doubt these were made in house, but three very large flat strips of chicken without thick breading so it was mostly chicken and thus very filling. 

Crispy haddock sandwich - crispy as stated, not soggy or greasy, but barely any flavor because they were either too stingy with the sauce or the sauce had no actual flavor. Hard to tell because there was so little of it. 

Tator tots - Always crispy on the outside. Perfect crunch, but then soft inside. 
Yukon Gold fries -- day to day, the size of the fries varied. Once they were thinner, the next day fatter, but wider. The latter seemed fresher and crisper, whereas the previous batch was darker, as if they used old oil. 

Have a small selection of cupcakes by the register. Honestly, one of the best cupcakes I've ever had and they only had one chocolate left the first night. Chocolate frosting was buttery and rich yet light and whipped in texture. Super moist cake. I wasn't able to get it again after since they seem to buy more vanilla based flavors and in small numbers, like 3 per flavor.",2,1,1,positive

  - Double Decker (Cheese and Lettuce)
  - Yukon Gold Fries

Price:

I found this to be quite an expensive meal given the portion for the meal I purchased.  The Yukon Gold Fries I felt were a fair deal however the burger seemed to small to be worth the $10.95 price tag (and that's without bacon).

Size:

I found the size of the Yukon Gold Fries were satisfying however the burger was much too small for my liking.  Everyone has their preferences but if you have a similar appetite, this burger will leave you feeling hungry once finished as it did for me.

Quality:

The quality is something to boast about and somewhat over compensates for the stiff price.  The burger was very juice and you could taste the freshness of the patties based solely on the fact that it melts in your mouth as you chew down. The fries had a certain ""zing"" to it that I found delicious compared to your typical fast food restaurant.

We had the BBQ Bacon Burger which I thought was okay - nice heat from the jalapeno, slight bacon flavour, creaminess of the avocado. They indicate they cook all their burgers to medium. This burger was more like medium well.
We also had the OFD Burger - this was VERY medium rare, I felt uncomfortable eating it but couldn't do anything about it because we did take out. Had I been dining in the restaurant, I would have sent it back to be cooked more. The dominant flavour was the tomato jam - the mushrooms, bacon and swiss cheese were all lost. 
We had the yukon gold fries (tasted like frozen fries, pretty soggy) and the sweet potato tater tots (obviously made from frozen, but they were tasty.)
$33 for all that (no drinks!) - I will take that money somewhere else that uses quality ingredients and knows how to cook a burger.",2,0,0,positive

Stick with the OFD\/Our Burgers and skip whatever seasonal or proprietary concoction they're trying to pass off as a burger. Laughable to call it a gourmet burger house as I consider the bymark burger to be barely acceptable and Wahlburger's obviously isn't even remotely in the same league. Hit up Marben or nota bene if you are looking for a real, well-rounded gourmet burger. 

Service - Disinterested and curt counter servers. Take out orders take 15-25 minutes to render (even if you're the only one in line). Shuffle to the side after you order and watch whatever sporting event they are streaming and cheer for the sports ball game. 

Tater tots - hit and miss with their crispiness, often times soggy, laden with grease
Fries - not too greasy, pretty decent, but ask them to go easy on the salt unless you like licking salt blocks and relish next day salt bloat
Onion rings - skip these, comes out a soggy mess 4 out of 5 times

OFD burger - can barely discern the swiss cheese, all their buns are cheap white buns with zero redeeming features, no premium fluffy artisanal sesame studded stuff to be found here. Subsequently they get soggy real fast and falls apart while eating (their housemade tomato jam is super jammy), fat, juicy and greasy patty (8 oz. might look paltry in the box but that thing is a killer), will leave you uncomfortably full afterwards but man those first 2-3 bites are just so darn satisfying
Our burger - just a consistently satisfying burger, again the cheese is barely discernible, the pickles are too thin, the bun is a mushy disgrace but if you are low on iron, this thing will get you right back to where you need to be
BBQ Bacon burger - the jalepeno packs some heat and makes this burger a lot more interesting then it actually is, their choice of bacon doesn't add much to the flavor or texture of the burger, BBQ sauce is awkward and cheap tasting, skip it
Thanksgiving burger - a confused concept but basically tastes exactly as it sounds. Order it if you want a leaner cut of meat (the stuffing is quite good quite) but be prepared to feel strangely empty as you eat this grey-ish and sullen-looking patty and ask yourself how someone's tastebuds could be so immature and misguided that they would be compelled to tack this on as a ""Wahlfave",1,1,2,positive

It's basically the same service as you would get in the restaurant, without the annoying TV monitors blinding you and your server telling you, you've been charged 18% gratuity, without even seeing the menu yet.

I ordered the Thanksgiving Turkey Burger with the sweet potato tater tots.  I was expecting a lot based off my friends recommendations and the TV show they have, but boy was I underwhelmed.  My burger was dry and tasted like it was previously frozen.  I could not even tell it was turkey to be honest and there was barely any stuffing or cranberry on it.  The tater tots were also pretty average and tasted like something straight out of a package of McCain fries.

Needless to say, I probably won't be coming back here unless I'm desperate for a burger or my friends drag me out here again.  Look elsewhere if you want quality fast food hamburgers like South Street.  Heck, even Harvey's is better than this place and about 1\/4 the price!",6,4,0,positive

It was juicy and topped with yummy condiments - the hot sauce was spicy but not so much that it was unbearable; the caramelized onions added a sweetness to the burger, and the peameal was added a smoky flavour that I didn't find annoying (normally I dislike peameam bacon...yeah, I know).

In terms of the actual food, it was tasty, the burger was cooked well and the tots were nice and crispy, yet squishy on the inside... the way tots are made to be. 

There was tons of Wahlberg things on the wall and the top 10 movie clips or something playing above the bar.

The eh?!? burger was alright. It had peameal bacon, a nice juicy beef patty, and a runny egg. It was gigantic and tasted great but granted runny eggs is probably not the best idea in a burger. The meal got real messy real quick.

Would not recommend the banana fluffanutta dessert. It can be easily made at home in under 5 mins with bread, pb, Nutella and bananas. Not worth the $5.

The restaurant has an interesting setup. In the front (bar area) you have a typical sit down service restaurant, but in the back is an order counter where you can get your food ""fast food"" style. We sat at the bar where there was various sports on the multiple TVs in the area. Most had on Soccer and Baseball, while a few were dedicated to showing clips from the Wahlburgers TV show. Other than that there wasn't a ton of Wahlberg memorabilia. 

The food was good. Was it the best burger I've had? No, but it was still a pretty good burger. I got the melt which was on two slices of thick cut toast, ""government cheese"" as they called it (American), and onions. As usual, I held the onion. I was a little surprised the burger was not cooked to order, it was just a medium well. It was still juicy though. Also, the bread did not get soggy which is a major bonus (talking to you Burgatory). 

Our bartender was the star off the show though. He was really talkative in a good way. Conversed with us, made recommendations, and was just all around pleasant and fun.

The burger I got was a double BBQ bacon burger.  

The good:
Let me say that the flavours were pretty damn good! Good mix of jalapeño, avocado & sauce
Fries were good. Takeout service was friendly.

The bad: 
It was tiny! I was starving so I got a double thinking it would fill me up. Not so. These are not than much bigger than a slider in diameter at least. Fries & burger $17+-

Though it quickly becomes obvious that Wahlburgers charges a premium on their menu items for being a celeb-owned resto. As pricey as it may be for a modest-sized burger, I would still recommend it. 

I went for the 'Eh' burger, which is a protein powerhouse, comprising of: a fried egg, beef pattie, and peameal bacon. I teamed it with the sweet potato tots, which I must say, was an excellent combo (counteracting the savoury with the sweet). Not to mention, sweet potato tots were priced the same as the fries and onion rings, which is unusual but nice!

The regular burger (5 oz) is stacked tall but modest in diameter and circumference. If I can compare it to anything, it would be a large slider. But don't let that discourge you, the content of the burger is made to perfection, albeit very messy to eat. If you are a big eater, you may want to upsize the burger to 8 oz. The tots surpassed my expectations and then some. They were crispy on the outside with a perfect sweet center. This is a must-try for all sweet potato enthusiasts out there.",0,0,0,positive

The place is a lot bigger than we expected, with a seated table-service area in the front and take out in the back and upstairs. We liked the decor; it's perfect for the area with the Skydome (or Rogers Centre, whatever) nearby because it has a more upscale sports bar vibe. Good for groups and kids too! 

As for the food - I ordered the Thanksgiving burger (their turkey option) and regular tots, while my boyfriend ordered the BBQ Bacon burger with the sweet potato tots. We both really enjoyed our food. I will admit that the burgers do look a little small when you receive them (especially if you order the 5 oz. like I did), but these burgers are more about height than width and are definitely filling. The portions of tots are quite large, I had to get my boyfriend to help me out with mine. I will say that my tots were too salty and I kind of wished I ordered the sweet potato ones, as they were definitely more flavourful, but that's my own fault. I was also disappointed that there was no sparkling water and I was served tonic water instead. Yuck.

A burger and a side comes in just under $15, which is pretty standard for fancier burger places in Toronto. Not sure why so many people are complaining about the price when most are quick to shell out $12 for McDonald's and their mystery ingredients without a complaint...

Not such a great decision. I sat at the bar, where I was ignored by three indifferent bartenders for well over 5 minutes even though they weren't busy. The bar seats approx. 12 -15 people I guess, and there weren't more than 7 people seated at it, including me so I'm not sure why I had to wave the guy over in order to get a beer. 

Anyway, I ordered the ""Our Burger"" (which is supposedly what they built their rep on) and a side of onion rings. When my meal arrived, the burger itself looked great. The onion rings, on the other hand, did not. The menu describes the onion rings as ""crispy fried bermuda onion sliced thin, tossed in sea salt & parsley"", which apparently means a large bowl of onion strings - the type that belong as a burger topping, and which no one in their right mind would consider or attempt to eat as a side order.

As I said, the burger looked great, but looks were deceiving. A shiny, brioche-style bun was strangely hard, and the burger patty was dry and had the consistency of one that was previously frozen. The toppings were good. That's the best I can say about that. 

Service from the bartender didn't improve either. No one checked to see how my meal was, and it was up to me to motion them over so I could get a fork for the mouthful of onion straws that I ate (definitely not finger food) and later to get a refill on my beer. By the way, props for them at least offering a decent selection of draft instead of the usual macro brewed crap.

PROS:
This is a very good central Downtown Toronto location, can't beat the spot on Blue Jays Way.
Decent service noted considering the typical busy lunch period on a Saturday and especially for a long weekend.  Waited approx. 10 minutes for my order so not bad. 
Main level seating area was fairly clean.  

CONS: 
I tried the OFD burger for myself and can honestly say that I have had much better.  I also understand the higher price for the central downtown \/ hotel location but this burger was bland (meat had no seasoning at all) and also way to much oil overall, which turned the potential brioche-style bun into a soggy disaster.  The tomato jam was more like regular tomato sauce, quite disappointing.  My friend tried The Melt, also way to much oil and wrong choice of bread used in my opinion (regular white toast), which crumbled apart because of all the wet ingredients - could have been better with a thicker bun. So $30.00 for 2 burgers and one drink, was not worth it at all.  
Decided to sit at the upper level since the main level was quite full, big mistake (should have taken our food to go) because the tables were not wiped down, lots of napkins and garbage on the floor & messy condiment area.........some fast food joints out there do a much better job with the cleanliness and upkeep.  Although the upper level is a more casual seating area, it should not be overlooked.

I'm rating this place 2 stars based on the quality of food vs overall price, and the lack of cleanliness.   There are better burger places in the city that are worth the price.",0,0,0,positive

I had company in town and they are fans of the tv show, so when I mentioned that there's a Wahlburgers in Toronto, we had to do the drive into town to check it out. 
We arrived on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm..the place was packed. We were told by the very friendly hostess that the wait time was substantial (as there were 8 of us), but we were free to order ourselves and dine upstairs. This is the option we took.
I ordered 2 BBQ Bacon Chessebugers, 1 Tater Tots, 1 fry, 2 pops....bill came to $36.05. Seriously...$36.05.

So....it's very similar to 5 guys...you order your meal and then wait for your order. Time from ordering to the meal coming out was just over 20 minutes.  While waiting, 1 customer brought his burger back complaining it was cold. The girl behind the counter asked what was cold, the meat or the bun. He burst out laughing and said ""all of it"". She then asked the question again.....? WTH? It took over 10 minutes for a ""warm burger"" to come up. The girl working the counter kept reminding the kitchen to rush his order...and a kitchen staff member yelled back (and we could all hear it) that she'd get it ""when he was ready to give it to her"" and that he ""couldn't cook the meat any faster"". While this was going on, another customer brought her order back as it was incorrect (they didn't give her what she ordered). She had to wait at least 10 minutes to get a replacement. The manager was apologetic to both individuals and did offer free fries to both of them as compensation for the error. 

Anyways...on to our order.

The burger itself was very dry, which is odd because the burger meat is moist. The meat itself is tasty...and although it looks small, it is filling. The jalapeños (there were 3 of them) were very mild, the cheese (white government cheese) melted off the top and surrounded the burger, the bacon..el cheapo.....it was 1 thin strip (couldn't even taste it)..overall, the burger was a huge let down. Fries were on the cool side...definitely not hot. Tater tots reminded me of the ones you get at Burger King for breakfast...Yikes. 

Overall, a huge disappointment. 

Won't be back.

We had friends with us (a family of 6...2 adults, 4 children)  They ordered 2 melts, fries, onion rings, 3 smahlburgers.....5 pops. Bill came to just over $60. They were shell shocked and the kids did not like the burgers at all. She also said the onion rings were odd...they're not standard fare...very little breading and she said they were pretty flavourless. Both adults said they were disappointment with the meal and that they won't go back, even if in the area.

I guess the novelty of the owners is the draw...it may be enough to get people in the doors...it won't keep them coming back.

We walk in, there are three very young teenage girls just standing by the hostess stand. I look at them and say, we have two can we get a table. ""Oh sit anywhere."" Okay that's the first mistake because now they are not evenly placing people to the waiters' tables, and now the waiter has no idea that we are his table. After ten minutes of just sitting at the table, we ask a hostess if we could get our order taken and she finds us a waiter; who again probably did not know we were his table. After about 35 minutes our burgers and tots arrive; why such a long wait, it wasn't packed in there. Every so often I would look around at the staff, two bartenders? On a Thursday? They looked bored out of their minds. Why three hostesses? And they would all stand together and just talk, about six or seven of the staff would just stand around and do nothing but chat. Where's the management? Also, the girls' uniforms? Seriously? If the skirts were one inch shorter I could tell if they had bikini waxes, as a woman, I am disgusted. So the food arrives, my bf orders his medium rare. His is over well done; sends it back. Within two minutes he has a replacement, again over well done. Finally, what appears to be the manager comes over and explains that in Canada the meat needs to be cooked a certain way and has to be frozen first. The burgers were gross. I had lumpy things in mine and kept having to spit it up. Also, the menu lists the cheese as ""government cheese."" What the hell is this? Are we welfare recipients? I want Swiss or Chedder on my burger, not government cheese. Is this only like this in Canada, is the Boston Wahlburgers different? So the Manager at least comps by bf's burger, now he is starving after having been in this establishment for almost an hour. The regular tater tots were too salty for me to eat and the sweet potato ones tasted funny, maybe it was the oil they used. I don't know, it was just a very disappointing meal and still cost over $20 even with the comp'd burger. Never again will I go here. Terrible service and terrible food.",3,1,0,positive

We came here before a Blue Jays game, the place was packed and loud but they do have a good system for alerting you via text when your table is available. We waited about 20 minutes which wasn't too bad. It took quite a while before anyone came to take our order but it was busy so it is understandable. There are two levels, what appeared to be a takeout counter and TV screens, good for sports fans. 
The reason why I will not be coming back here and why I cannot give them anything more then a 'meh' 2 rating is because they claim to have something for everyone, but I ended up having to eat an order of sweet potato tots as a dinner. Their 'veggie burger' option was a mushroom which had more mushrooms on it as a topping, please note Wahlburgers, not every vegetarian likes or wants to eat mushrooms with more mushrooms. The salads were super limited and the caesar had anchovies in it so I couldn't have that.

Beer is totally over priced so I'd not recommend this place for a long night of drinking (which we inadvertently did). 18% auto-grat for everyone if you dine in - not just for large parties - which is unusual so beware of that as well.

I would have much rather that the just played his movie or something.

Overall, it was enjoyable, but I doubt I will return.",3,0,0,positive

Our server was nice but not on top of things. We ordered and she didn't write it down properly I guess so she had to come back and ask twice what we ordered. My drink was also empty and she walked by multiple times and I had to stop her to order another drink.

Both times, I was not super impressed with their burgers. 

Pros: 
- The staff is very nice and always friendly
- Tater Tots are not bad but you can always buy your own bag of McCains
- The services is relatively quick (you can be in and out in an hour)

Cons
- The burgers are very greasy (I know, burgers are not suppose to be super healthy, but doesn't mean the buns are gleaming with grease) 
- The burgers are put together very haphazardly. I had the original burger and turkey thanksgiving burger. Both times, I need a billion napkins, which they graciously give, to clean up the sauce that is oozing out the burger. I get the need to have sauce on a burger, but not to the point where it is coming out from all sides of the bun and making your bun soggy. 
- The burgers just don't match up to some of the great burger joints in Toronto like Burger Priests, Parts and Labour or even franchises like Milestones or Jack Astors. 
- The wait times to get a spot. I got it when they first opened, but as I seen in the reviews below, no matter what time or day, even if the restaurant is not at full capacity, you will have to wait while their staff cleans the tables. It seems they have a very inefficient way of running things, they don't have a bus boy\/girl cleaning up the mess. The hostess is often running around spraying tables, cleaning up messes and setting up tables. Often, you see a table where the servers have clearly used as a dumping ground for unclean glasses.  This turns me off, but what really sets a bad taste in my mouth when there are CLEAN TABLES AVAILABLE FOR SEATING, but your servers are slow in setting the table!  So, Mark, why am I waiting to be seated when you have tables for seating?

I am aware that the burger chain is a venture by movie star Mark Wahlberg and his brothers, and that there is also a reality TV show based around it. Since I generally don't view reality TV, I can care less what it's about; sounds stupid to me anyhow. However it freaked me out when the first sign posted at the entrance is a legal public film\/photography waiver notice. That's a first in my eating out experience.

No film crew on my visit. But the second thing I saw entering was a throng of people behaving like tourists, gawking and snapping pictures at every detail of the establishment. Walking out after eating here or entering, it seems like I just stepped into a tourist trap. This is not a celebrity chef's place like Susur Lee (who has a restaurant** on the other side of the Soho Metropolitan Hotel building that also houses Wahlburgers). This is a Hollywood celebrity's restaurant, of course you'll feel like you're in a scene and say you've been here! Roll out the red carpet... and get the fuck outta way; this is a food serving establishment, not a TIFF premiere.

The layout is confusing. The front part is dedicated to full service restaurant operations, including waiter service and yes, alcohol! They sure love for you to sit down here. Further back and a couple turns later is the usual and more empty quick service order counter, plus some casual seating that extends to the upper level mezzanine.

As a warning, the menu for burgers only show the price for their 'regular' size. Something I learned the hard way when I was asked if I want the 5oz or 8oz. 5? Only kids eat the 5oz patty! I want the 8 ouncer! Super size that shit; it's the all-American way, right? Upsell wins, well played.

The ""Our Burger"" 5er is $9.69 on the posted menu, but super sized will run ya $11.65, $13.16 with tax.

And what is this 8oz signature Our Burger? It looked like fast food roadkill to begin with. The 8oz beef patty is an oval shaped elongated thing sandwiched between two microscopic kids meal sized buns, sticking out profoundly like IKEA purchases that could not fit in the car so you drive away with the trunk open. It was pathetically tiny overall, the juices was dripping mad like a horribly leaky faucet, and tasted like a typical fast food chain burger. Nothing special, nothing enjoyable, not impressed. The ingredients were barebones basic--tomatoes, pickles, processed cheese, confetti sized lettuce... if you can belt off the Big Mac song, it pretty much describe what they put in it. It took five minutes to prepare this disappointment for me (whilst waiting for my 4-digit order number to be called--sure felt like Mr. Bean in the waiting room scene, because how many thousand more people could there be before me?), and another five to eat it. A $13 burger should not take me five or less minutes to consume. I felt sorry for the cows who were sacrificed to produce this blasphemous ripoff.

In summary, Wahlboogers is a disappointing, overhyped, and deceptive experience where the star ingredient used is the name itself. Should you go here, do not get the Our Burger, though based on my experience I cannot imagine their other stuff being any more exciting. I felt like I paid for a pack of silver lined underwear for Marky Mark, for it wasn't worth it. With their high prices for small lame products, one could get much better and more enjoyable burgers--be it a fancy gourmet thing or a  greasy thick wonder--elsewhere on the $10-14 range.

For being an establishment from the Wahlberg brothers, I was expecting a great place, good service and amazing food, but was quite disappointed that it didn't deliver according to the hype.  It was comfort food, but at gourmet sizes and prices.

Upon entering through the first door, there's a warning on the wall of being videotaped or recorded, then through the second door, there's brightness from all the greenery decor.  Decent size seating area with full-sized bar and lots of TVs throughout the restaurant.  Like other Yelpers had commented, it felt like I walked into a sports bar.

Luckily there was some sort of walkway that guided me to the ordering counter.  Menu  items were clearly displayed and I thought the prices were quite reasonable because normal prices for good burgers with fries in restaurants ranges from $12 - $18 on average.

I came late Sunday afternoon and there was no line-up, but a group of people waiting for their orders off to the side. The cashier didn't seem friendly and I felt like I had bothered her with my smile while I waited for her to acknowledge me so I can place my order.  

I managed to place my order of BBQ Bacon Burger ($9.95) and Yukon Gold Fries ($3.50), then proceeded to the side to wait while observing the staff.  The two cashiers didn't look happy and the kitchen staff looked miserable from what I saw and it wasn't even that busy. 

Although I indicated that I was dining in to the cashier, receipt showed takeout, hence, my order came in a white paperbag with the Wahlburgers logo even when I tried to stop the other cashier from placing my food in the paperbag informing her I was dining in.  So much for trying to save a paper bag. Nice packaging for the burger and cute container for the fries, but what a major disappointment when I opened the burger box.  I was very shocked to see how small the burger was.  

For the price of $9.95, I was expecting a normal size burger, but what I received was a burger that resembled something slightly larger than a slider. Plus the bun looked like it was manhandled with all the dents on it.  I was hungry, so took a quick photo before taking my first bite.  I wasn't impressed at all.  Too much BBQ sauce that seemed to overpower the burger, cheese wasn't melted all the way, plus I only tasted avocado near the end and almost forgot it was part of the burger.  It seemed like they forgot and only placed a dollop of avocado, perhaps that explained the manhandled bun which didn't taste fresh. The saving grace was the bacon which was done nicely and crispy.

The fries were quite tasty and I ate them plain since it was nicely salted, but for $3.50 it just doesn't seem worth the price for the small amount I received.

I think I would rather have my burger and fries elsewhere.  At least I can say I tried Wahlburgers.  Sadly, this will be my first and last visit.",5,0,0,positive

Burger buns were on the cold side and the patty was kinda small and tasteless. Not juicy at all! I think the burger to bun ratio is a bit off, too much bread vs. meat. Cesar salad was a bit tasteless and I think it was due to the fact the lettuce was still wet from being cleaned which diluted the dressing and made the lettuce limp.
