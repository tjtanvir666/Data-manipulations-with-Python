There was a pretty good selection of pizzas, stuffed pizzas and 2 other kinds of stromboli. 

The pepperoni and cheese stromboli is amazing. It was a good pepperoni to cheese to bread ratio, and it was not too salty.

We went back to try the broccoli, chicken and cheese stromboli but that was nothing like the pepperoni and cheese. Don't even bother.",0,0,0,positive

They were not hot whatsoever when I received them. There was no sauce on it and barely any cheese. It was basically just dough with pepperonis on it. The check out lady was not friendly, did not ask me how I wanted to pay - she assumed it was debit and walked away to do something else. I waited for her to come back to tell her it was cash and she was visibly annoyed. Terrible experience.",1,0,0,positive

No customer service, they messing up the orders, overcharging your bill. At least, they are well trained at fooling the customers.

The spaghetti was very soft and the meatballs were maybe 3\/4 cooked. The pizza was subpar and had looked like it had been sitting around all day but wasn't, it was straight out of the oven. The meal wasn't cheap either, over $20. I can honestly say I won't be back.",0,0,0,positive

I went just after 8pm where they advertise buy one slice of pizza, get one free as an end of the day special.  The girl working there almost didn't want to give us the special even though it was clearly after 8pm....kinda confusing. She just had a weird attitude and lacked any customer service skills. Anyways,  she warmed up 2 slices, and both tasted really bad. Dry, no flavour, it was almost hard to get any motivation to eat it....I mean, I think I would've preferred getting a slice if pepperoni pizza from 7-11 for much less! 

Even with the bogo free deal, I wouldn't recommend it, definitely not worth the $5.",2,0,0,positive

Had a pizza craving and ordered a pizza slice from here. The bottom crust was soft (soggy) and the slice couldn't hold it's shape or toppings; the whole thing fell apart before I could even take my first bite. It was stressful trying to eat it and tasted extremely disappointing, definitely did not do anything for my pizza craving. After googling other pizza joints, I realized pizza pizza was only 5 mins down the block from dundas so went there to get my pizza fix instead",3,0,0,positive

Had a Stromboli, which was massive to begin with and then they tacked on two breadsticks for the combo. I'm not sure how they expect someone to eat that much dough. Only managed about 50% of the Stromboli. The quality just wasn't there.",1,0,0,positive

I get that it's food court food, but it's not cheap either and for the price I paid I expect better service. The workers seemed disinterested and entirely unhelpful. The pasta was overcooked and lacked any real flavor - I could've cooked better pasta myself! Would not recommend this place to anyone.

Not at all like the Sbarros in the US which are actually decent; maybe Canada shouldn't have Sbarro. Pizza tastes like plastic and chemicals and pasta is obvious at first sight as being not cooked in the tradition al dente way and even might be processed or something. Food is lukewarm and sometimes even cold. Do not waste your money here. And oh yeah, bringing me to my last point, it's horribly overpriced. Employees are stupid. A pathetic pre-recorded voice machine announces ""Hey there, welcome to Sbarro"" to attract patrons passing by who I hope don't bother. Just don't.",4,0,0,negative

If I say I ONLY want a slice don't make it sound like a combo is my only option then talk up the ""free"" sides and charge $10.50 once I get to the till... I feel like their workers are forced by management to upsell to customers their expensive combos. I could've gotten chipotle across the street for less and I consider that a treat as far as fast food goes in between classes (I'm a Ryerson student). the food is cold and bland and overpriced, you're far better off getting pizza anywhere else close by. 

I've had sbarros in Wisconsin and Chicago first (which is the only reason why I tried this location) and it was cheaper and better quality. you should leave Canada if you aren't going to honour the standard set by American franchisees.",1,0,0,positive

The mini caesar salad I got on the side had soft croutons and it was the blandest thing I ever had. The dressing did not help because it tasted weird. I know this is a food court in a mall but this place charges like $5 for a nasty slice. Save yourself the time and effort and go somewhere else. Also, the cashier girl is bland and not pleasant.
